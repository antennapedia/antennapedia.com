Clara was shaken, but not out of control. She could handle this. The Doctor had awakened, fine, great. He'd somehow arrived at the scene before they had. He was still wildly dangerous, though, still not in his right mind. He was in his nightshirt even in the cold air, standing on the parapet of the bridge, insulting them all for not understanding the problem in front of them. He jabbed a finger in the direction of a man he found suspicious.

"He seems remarkably unmoved by the available spectacle," Lady Vastra said.

Clara turned, a question on her lips, and snapped her mouth shut. The Doctor was standing on the parapet as before, yes, but he'd changed. He'd *changed*. Huge gray wings spread out from his back. He pointed in the direction of the fleeing figure, and said, "aha!"

He spread his wings -- his *wings*, his steel-gray *wings* -- and leapt from the parapet. He fell, swooped, flapped, and was in flight. Clara watched him, hand to her mouth, until he vanished in the murk.

"Well well," said Lady Vastra. "That's new."

It was days later, in the TARDIS, after all was done, and they were on their way back to her home. He was dressed properly now, in a dark blue coat with a red lining. He closed his eyes, tensed his shoulders, and then there was that rustle and that breath of air on her face, and there they were again: wings, magnificent, the same gray as his hair. Fifteen feet. His eyes were closed and his hands spread out at his sides, palms up. The wings spread out, beat once, and folded against his back. He opened his eyes again.

"This regeneration was a bit of a wild one," he said, and he flashed a smile at her.

"How," Clara said. "How."

"I'm bigger on the inside."

"But--"

"I know. It's rare, but things like this sometimes happen. The energy flowing when they answered your plea-- the battle in progress. I can't say."

He shrugged, but Clara thought she saw something else on his face. Fear, or shame, or something she didn't like seeing there. It was a strange face to her, but she'd seen all of the faces that came before this one, and she never liked seeing shame on any of them.

"Can I-- can I touch them?"

That was the right thing to ask, because he smiled again and this time it was a lovely smile, heartfelt. He turned and spread them again for her. Clara came close to him and laid a hand very gently between his shoulder blades. Such a thin man he was in this regeneration, narrow shoulders, thin back. He was quivering with tension under her hands. She could see the feathers trembling.

She laid a hand on a wing. Feathers, sleek feathers, soft and yet with bone underneath. Such a rich color, so much more complex than mere gray now that she was looking at it. There was iridescence in them, a shimmer under the lights.

"So beautiful," she said, and he shivered. "And you can fly."

"I went to a planet of winged people and learned properly. Took a week. I still have the bruises."

"And you didn't take me?"

"I wasn't-- wasn't sure you'd come."

"Why would you think that?"

"You were angry. You wanted him back, not me. Because I look different now. I am different now."

"You're him."

"And I'm not him."

"I've met you before."

"But not like this."

Clara sighed. It was true. He'd never been human, but he'd always looked human until now. "Not like this."

His wings folded up and he hunched over himself. "I'll understand if you leave."

"Leave?" She'd been thinking about it. She had to admit it. He'd frightened her in that restaurant. But he'd also intrigued her and now-- now that she saw the challenge, now that she saw his fear, there was no chance she would leave him. "Sorry," she said. "I'm staying."

He turned, and she saw that he was as uncertain and desperate as she'd ever seen him. "Even though I'm like this?"

"Doctor--" She stepped close to him again and laid a hand on his chest. "You have two hearts. You're not the same species as me. You think I'm going to let wings get in the way?"

A wan smile from him, and he touched her hand where it rested on his chest. A brief touch, as if he were afraid of her.

She said, "Besides, I like them."

That smile again, the heart-stopping one that Clara knew she'd spend years chasing if she had to. "Seriously?"

"Seriously."

She hopped up on her tiptoes and pulled him down into a hug. He protested, then his arms closed around her awkwardly. To her awe and delight, the wings followed. She was in the embrace of the wings of an angel. Her angel. Her Doctor, with the new face, and the attack eyebrows, and the graceful hands. And the wings.
