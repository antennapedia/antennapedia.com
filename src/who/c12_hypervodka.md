## One

Clara dragged her heels on her way through the TARDIS door. It closed behind her the moment she was properly inside, and the Doctor instantly threw home the lever. The rotors turned. Clara sighed.

"No time to waste, slowpoke," the Doctor said.

Yeah. She didn't have any more time to waste. It was now or never, and never was impossible. Though she could yet chicken out. She could. But running away was not something Clara Oswald was going to start doing now.

"Doctor."

"Clara?"

"Remember the night with the hypervodka?"

The Doctor smiled briefly: a moment of mutual embarrassment. Clara was sympathetic. There had been karaoke with a group of strangers in a bar on Ceti Alpha VI. The Doctor had belted out "Bohemian Rhapsody" like the best of them. There had been hypervodka shots. More shots. A duet on "Endless Love" that she really wished she couldn't remember.

He said, "Parts of it. Mostly the parts before the bar. After that, not so much."

"Do you remember waking up?"

"What's this about?"

Clara ignored him and repeated herself, more firmly. "Do you remember waking up?"

The Doctor chewed on his forefinger. "Yes. Vividly. My head felt like it was doing the Titanian Two-Step all on its own."

"You were in your bedroom when you woke up. With your clothes all over the floor."

He stopped chewing on his forefinger and stared at her instead. "How do you know that?"

"Because I woke up first. In your bedroom. With you."

His mouth opened and closed a few times. "We-- we-- Did we?"

"Yeah, we did. I didn't remember it, but it must have happened, because. Well. Just because." Because of the way her body had felt, because of the love bites in odd places, because of the chafing in places she did not want to describe to him.

"And I didn't remember either," he said, so quietly she wasn't sure she'd heard it.

"Yeah. That was pretty obvious the next morning."

His hands were now deep in his trouser pockets, and he was looking at the floor instead of at her. "Hypervodka is dangerous like that. I'm sorry."

"Well, it's okay, sort of. We're both adults. We probably knew what we were doing. Even though we don't remember it."

He smiled at her very briefly, then moved toward the other side of the console from her. Clara followed. He pressed a few buttons as if they were the most important buttons ever, then stopped abruptly. He folded his arms, unfolded them, then shoved his hands deep into his trouser pockets again.

"Forgive me, Clara, but that was two months ago. Why bring it up now?"

"It's only sort of okay. I, um." There was no letting him off the hook on this one, but now that it came to it, she didn't know how to say it. Words. Gone. Where had they gone? She'd written a speech out in post-it notes, but they were not in front of her now.

"What?"

Clara couldn't find any way to say what she had to say next without yelling and she wasn't angry at anybody other than herself and she was more scared than angry anyway. So she pulled the little stick out of her pocket and held it out to him.

The Doctor took it gingerly and looked. Then he handed it back, pulled out his sonic, and scanned her.

"Yeah," she said, when she saw his face change.

He yanked the viewscreen around toward them. He did something to the sonic and scanned her again. The monitor changed to a display of what she assumed were her guts, color-coded and moving in three dimensions. She leaned closed to take a look: tables of numbers flickering, an image of her belly, a cavity, a moving thing inside. He pointed at one of the charts of letters. It changed to a display of a double helix spinning, with labels along the edges.

Clara craned closer to the image on the screen. "Is that the baby's DNA?"

"Yes. It's Time Lord DNA. My DNA. Your DNA. The thing I don't understand is-- oh."

"What *oh*? Explain *oh*. You don't get to say *oh* and then not explain it."

"I was merely wondering how this--" he stabbed a finger at the helix -- "happened. Humans and Gallifreyans can interbreed, yes, but to produce *this* requires intervention."

"Who intervened?"

"It happened on the TARDIS. She'd have-- there are machines-- I once set up something so that if -- I set it up originally for River, a very long time ago, but nothing came of it. She was angry with me and so I went off for a year and built a semi-autonomous gene splicer and then when I went back to her the next day her time she was still angry and I'd completely forgotten what we were fighting about. And then I forgot about this. Until now."

He was babbling. Still babbling, though Clara wasn't paying attention any more. Well, that was annoying. She was pregnant because a thousand years ago he'd set up something to let his wife get pregnant, maybe, if they'd ever decided to, and the machine had just blithely done something with her DNA and his DNA and then it had spliced them together into a fertilized egg without even so much as *asking* her and she couldn't even remember it.

Though she did remember the love bites on her shoulders. Those had taken days to fade. She'd been mortified because they'd been left by *him* and neither of them remembered it. She'd had wild monkey sex with the Doctor, and he'd got her pregnant, and she was going to have a Time Lord baby and she didn't even *remember* it.

There was a clatter and a thump. The Doctor was now kneeling on the floor, with the screwdriver rolling away from him. His hands were on her shoulders.

"Clara? Are you okay?"

Clara noticed that she was sitting on the floor next to the Doctor. Speaking of things she didn't remember: sitting down was another one.

"Yeah. I mean, aside from the morning sickness and the napping."

"And the sudden collapsing."

"That's like the napping. Third period I have free, and I spend it asleep in the faculty lounge. I used to wake up with my head on my desk until I got smart and started commandeering the couch."

"I think that's normal," he said. And then he reached out and laid a hand on her forehead, and tutted. The Doctor, who rarely touched her (except when he left love bites all over her shoulders, a traitorous part of her mind said), was touching her now, solicitously.

"Are you going to turn into one of those?"

"Those?"

Clara shook her head. He'd only deny it as if the suggestion outraged him.

"You seem well enough," he said.

"Doctor."

"What?"

"What are we going to do?"

He was watching her now, almost warily. "I don't know. What would you like to do?"

"What do you want to do?"

"I asked first."

"No, you didn't. I asked first."

"Oh."

He sat down on the console steps, just below her, with his legs crossed. His thumb went up to the corner of his mouth and he worried at it with his teeth. Clara watched him fret. Could she see him as a father? Yes, she could. He'd been a father once; he sometimes boasted of his dad skills, and from what she'd seen, they were real, if off-kilter from what the average human thought of as a dad skill. The question was, did he want to be a father right now? Did she want to be a mother if he didn't want to be a father? And what were Time Lord babies like, anyway?

"It's your body. It's up to you. You could terminate. You could put him into storage here in the TARDIS for a time later on when you wanted to carry him. You could put him into an artificial womb until he reaches full term. You could continue on the old-fashioned way."

"Wait. Wait a second. Did you say him?"

"Oh, sorry, yes, XY chromosomes, other gene sequences say he's probably going to turn out to be male in the usual way, which means most of the regenerations will be male except for a few extra-fun ones. I hope you didn't want to be surprised."

"It's okay. Um. That's a lot of choices. More than I knew I had."

"You don't have to decide yet. You have another week or so before some of the options become, er, tricky."

"Well, actually, I sort of know what I want to do already. It was just more a matter of, well, you."

"Me?"

"You. Do you want to help me raise him or would you prefer to show up on birthdays and give him wildly inappropriate presents that I'll have to hide away before he uses them to splice cat and dog DNA or engrave his name on the moon with a laser or--"

"Yes. Please."

"Which one?"

"Help. Raise him."

"Okay. See you do it, now. No vanishing for weeks at a time because you messed up the times. You're here--"

"Mostly."

"Mostly, and you're helping. Even with the nappies."

"Oh, nappies, there's a perfectly good robot that can do those, I got it working once when Ace came to visit with her twins and it only malfunc--"

"Shut up. You're changing nappies."

"Yes, boss."

They held hands now sometimes, at stressful moments. That was a thing. The Doctor would seek it out, even, and would hold her hand without any prompting whatsoever when things got weird. This hadn't changed after their drunken night together. He reached out for her hand now and laced his fingers through hers. They sat like that for a while, hand in hand on the TARDIS floor, and Clara felt better. She had had some vague idea that he might have fled instead of welcoming it, dumped her in Croydon and come back in five years to see how it worked out. But no, he was sticking around and holding her hand and still smiling at her like he'd been given a present. Which, well, maybe he had.

## Two

The first thing that happened was that the Doctor parked the TARDIS in a corner of Clara's living room and told her that was he was staying for the duration. Clara thought about objecting to losing the space until it occurred to her that she'd actually gained a lot of square footage. As in, an entire library, a city park, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and several miles of baffling corridors. And that was just to start. Who knew what else was hiding in there? Really, it was a straight-up improvement. So she smiled and nodded and tried to cope with the new reality of the Doctor as father-to-be, living in her flat, in and out at all hours of the day and night. Which seemed to be his intention; he'd taken her injunction not to vanish very seriously.

The second thing that happened was that he started outfitting a nursery in the corner of her bedroom, commencing with an odd cradle covered with markings in Gallifreyan.

"Mine, once," he said to her. "And later River's."

"And that's not weird in the slightest."

"A lovely tradition." He seemed to have chosen not to hear the irony in that.

"Why are you doing this?"

"He needs to sleep somewhere!"

"We have more than six months to do this. You do not need to re-arrange my entire flat right this instant."

The Doctor coughed delicately. "About that."

"What?" Clara said, dangerously.

"More like nine months."

"I'm ten weeks along!"

"Yes, and the gestation period for a Gallifreyan is a year, so there you are."

"A year?"

"Give or take."

Clara's mind shorted out. A year of this? A year of feeling queasy and taking unannounced naps and eating three meals and throwing up two of them? Then her mind latched onto the worst problem.

"But it's supposed to take 40 weeks. People will *notice* if it's longer. They'll freak out. They'll try to induce labor."

"Over my dead body!" he said, which was the strangest thing he'd ever said, because he didn't die. Much. In the usual way.

"So what do we do?"

"We travel," he said, instantly. "In my time machine. You pudding-brain. An extra twelve weeks in lovely peaceful spots, spread out."

"Do you even *know* any peaceful places?"

He looked mortally offended. "Of course I do!"

"The point is! The point. The point. Yeah. The point is that you have a lot of time. You do not need to completely re-arrange my flat right this second. You have even more time than I thought."

"It'll take a while to properly outfit a proper Gallifreyan nursery. Might as well start now."

Clara opened her mouth and then thought better of it. Keep him involved. Keep him active. If he got bored there was no predicting what would happen. She was never sure how long he would stay paying attention to any one thing, so make use of him now, while she had him. That was a depressing thought; did he deserve it? She looked sidelong at him, now fussing with the exact calibration of the orrery that hung over the cradle. At one point in his life he'd careened around the universe with his granddaughter. That argued for some kind of ability to stick around and see the consequences of his actions.

He probably didn't deserve it. She could probably trust him to stick around. Probably.

She sat down on the bed and watched him. She was tired again. Tired and hungry. She'd puked up her first dinner then immediately sat down and eaten a second larger one. The second had stayed down, thank goodness. Now she was hungry again. This was going to cost her a fortune in food. What did she want? She wanted tea. A nice mug of tea with milk and no sugar. Was she allowed to have tea? Caffeine was supposed to be bad. And it was Wednesday evening, and that meant it was a school night, and that meant she had to get a good night's sleep, which she wasn't going to do with this Time Lord careening all over her flat shouting cheerfully at her as he dragged caches of baby clothes out of the TARDIS.

"Oh my God," she said, "what *is* that?" She snatched a onesie off the pile. It was a particularly horrifying combination of scarlet and orange, and on the front it said: "Scion of Rassilon?"

The Doctor grinned at her, showing all of his teeth rather adorably. "Ace had those made. There should be a second one around here somewhere. Get your little Prydonian started right."

"Our little Prydonian?"

"Prydonian Chapter! Traditionally where the House of Lungbarrow ends up, we being a sneaky, devious lot." His grin turned rather frightening for a moment, and then it vanished, replaced by an expression she couldn't read. Thinking about Gallifrey for very long usually did that to him. Gallifrey was still hidden from him. From them, she supposed. But this seemed to be more complicated than that. That expression wasn't exactly wistful.

He set down the onesie onto the stack of clothing, then tossed the whole bundle into the crib. "You're right. I can work on this later. Plenty of time when you're in that school teaching those pudding-brains to read. Can they?"

"Can they what?"

"Read?"

"Yes, they can all read, Doctor."

"Good, good, better late than never."

And in that moment, Clara was shaken. He'd just reminded her that he was alien, completely and utterly alien, and he'd grown up somewhere she didn't know, in a family she'd never meet, in places she'd never see. How could she possibly raise the child of a Gallifreyan properly? She didn't even know his *name*. She called him by a title, not his name. How could she possibly think he'd stay around afterward? She was pregnant with an alien's baby.

Her face was wet. Damn these hormones. Damn the whole thing. What had made her think this was a thing she could survive?

"Clara?" he said. He was standing in front of her, looking completely upset. His hands were in his hair, pulling at it until it stood up straight.

"Doctor."

"Clara. What's wrong?"

"Nothing."

"Not one of your better lies."

Clara swiped her sleeve over her face. Well. He had a point there. "Nothing is wrong, really. Just-- The mother of your child needs a hug right now."

He didn't hesitate, but opened his arms. Clara moved into their circle and leaned her head against his chest. After a moment he closed his arms around her and squeezed. Clara felt him press a kiss to the top of her head. So much for not the hugging sort. If he ever said that to her again, she'd be able to tell him all the ways in which he lied.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes. Mostly. No."

"What do you need?"

"Could you-- could you stay? With me? Tonight. I don't mean, that is--"

"You need some company?"

"Yeah. Please."

He studied her for a moment, brow furrowed. "The TARDIS," he said. "Let's bank one or two of those extra days now, yeah?"

He smiled at her for an instant, then reached out for her hand. Clara took it and let him lead her out of her bedroom and through the open door of the TARDIS.

"You go get changed," he said. "I'll send us somewhere safe for tomorrow."

Clara felt the TARDIS shift out of the vortex just as she finished brushing her teeth. The Doctor knocked on the door and came in without waiting. At least he knocked. He didn't always remember to do that.

She climbed onto the bed and slid under the blankets. She had no idea what was going to happen next. Was he going to get into bed with her? Was he going to sit in the chair next to her bed and read? Or play his guitar and sing to her? That might be nice, actually. She hadn't heard him singing except by accident, when she'd walked in on him. He seemed to prefer to keep that to himself.

Clara watched the father of her child as he stood by the bed, looking at her. He bit at his thumb for a moment and seemed to come to some decision. Out came the screwdriver. He fiddled with it for a moment and aimed it at the ceiling. The light faded, shifted. The ceiling changed itself to a starlit night under a canopy of leaves, which was something that Clara knew the TARDIS could do but hadn't ever asked it to do. Sound faded in: wind in trees, insects, running water somewhere nearby. The Doctor set the screwdriver on the nightstand. He stood. Clara watched him take off his jacket silhouetted against the starscape. Then his cufflinks. Then he sat again and unlaced his boots. She'd never seen this ritual before. Never seen him in anything but full dress, fully-defended against the universe. Except for that one morning, when she'd woken up next to him. The night she couldn't remember, that ended up with her pregnant. The shirt came off next, revealing a t-shirt with a dancing skeleton printed on it. Then he pulled back the coverlet and slid himself under it, next to her.

"C'mere." He held out an arm. Clara snugged herself up against him. "Was that the right thing to do?"

"Yeah."

"Might make me some cue cards. When to hug you. When to make myself scarce."

"You're doing okay as is."

"Just let me know, will you?"

"Why are you being so, so helpful? So present?"

"You're carrying my child. Our child. It's the least I can do."

Clara pressed her face against his chest. She was pregnant. Everything was going to be different. A child. A boy. Half Gallifreyan, whatever that meant, and half human. She was going to be a mother. She'd always assumed she'd be a mother some day. She was afraid of it and not afraid of it at the same time. She knew it would change her, but she was okay with that. Sort of. Was she ready for it? What if she messed it up? What if she wasn't a good mother to a Gallifreyan baby? What if she cocked everything up? What if he turned out to take a hundred years to grow to adulthood? She might die before he was even a teenager.

Dammit, she was crying again. She wasn't even sure she could blame the hormones. This was scary and she was scared and she hadn't planned this and her life was out of control and--

"Clara," the Doctor said.

"What?" It came out sort of watery.

"I was a dad once. I told you, yeah?"

"Yeah. You had a granddaughter, even."

"Much later. I became a father when I was young. Older than you by a little bit, but still young by the standards of Gallifrey. So young." His voice was quiet, a little raspy. His hand shifted down and splayed out against her back.

"Did it-- was it okay? Did you make mistakes?"

"Oh, Clara, I made so many mistakes. But I got enough right that they, well, they turned out just fine. Got into less trouble than I did. Terrible disappointment."

There was laughter lurking in his voice, and that was more of a comfort to her than anything else. He was happy. He wanted this. She could hear it.

"It'll be okay," he said. "You'll be as amazing at this as you are at everything else."

And he kissed her forehead again. His hand rubbed her back, slowly, soothingly. The stars overhead, a stream running, crickets chirping, his warmth beside her: Clara fell asleep into dreams that were sweet and soothing.

When she woke, the Doctor was not in bed with her, but there was herbal tea and a glass of disturbingly blue juice waiting for her on the nightstand. The juice tasted wonderful, and so did the tea. This was, Clara supposed, the Doctor doing his absolute best to take care of her. It would do.

## Three

After that the TARDIS was a fixture in her living room, and the Doctor a fixture in her bed, sometimes the one in her flat in London, sometimes the one in the TARDIS. A chaste fixture, but a soothing one. Clara wasn't sure what she wanted from him, besides that, but this would do for now. He would lie with her until she fell asleep, then get up and do something inexplicable while she slept. She woke up one morning to find the walls and ceiling of her bedroom had been painted with nanobot-laced programmable paint that he'd set to simulate the sky over her flat, with all the constellations lovingly recreated.

Clara sat crosslegged on the bed eating a tub of full-fat yogurt-- amazing luxury of pregnancy, that she was supposed to eat the stuff that tasted good-- and looked up at her blue ceiling, at the sliver of crescent moon in the east. "And this is exactly the sky over London right now?"

The Doctor leaned in her doorframe with a mug of black coffee in his hands. He said, "Glasgow. Not London."

"Glasgow? Specifically Glasgow?"

"I've programmed in the seasons, too. Realistic day lengths."

"Why not Gallifrey?"

He shrugged then frowned at her, so she changed the subject. "I'm hungry." She looked mournfully into her empty pot of yogurt.

"Again?"

"Yes, again."

"More yogurt? We have outrageous amounts in the TARDIS."

"Fish and chips from that place you took me to that one time. Frankie's."

"For *breakfast*? Right, okay, I understand, back in a tick."

The TARDIS door closed behind him. Clara sighed and scraped at the bottom of the yogurt pot with her spoon. He'd likely be back straight away. He'd learned pinpoint control with the TARDIS, or he'd come to some agreement with her that allowed him to coax her into going when he wanted. The TARDIS vanished, and then it reappeared exactly where it had been, and the Doctor emerged with a paper dish in his hands that smelled exactly like what she'd been dreaming about, all salt and grease. Clara snatched the bag from his hands and dug out a chip, still steaming hot. Perfect. Delicious.

The Doctor sat on the edge of her bed. Clara ate another chip and tried not to make the kind of noises she wanted to be making. This had been exactly what she wanted. What the scion of Gallifrey wanted. She'd taken to calling him that when it would most irritate the Doctor, which was pretty much any time she said it. He was staring at her, she noticed.

"What?"

"Nothing!"

"You're watching me eat."

"Yeah."

"Are you criticizing me? Trying to say anything?"

"Just watchin' you. Worth it, going out to get those. Had to find cash for it. Ended up busking for an hour in the sunshine. Played *500 Miles* and earned enough for the chips before I'd reached the third verse."

"Get out," Clara said, through a mouthful of cod.

"Great song," the Doctor said. "I think I played it a decade before they wrote it." And he insinuated a hand into the bag and stole a chip. Clara slapped at him half-heartedly. If he'd busked for the chips, he'd more than earned it.

Clara dug into the newspaper for the next piece of fish. It emerged with a slice of lemon. "Ooh! Lemon!" And then she got a good whiff of it and her stomach did things. She wrapped it up in the paper as fast as she could. The Doctor took it out of her hands.

"You feeling okay?"

"Nausea. Again. Getting really tired of it. This was supposed to end at twelve weeks."

"Ah. Want me to get rid of the bag?"

Clara shook her head. She was feeling better with the lemon out of sight. There were at least five chips left that there was no way she was going to let him eat.

He said, "Implantation should be complete soon. It'll get easier on you. More eating, more sleeping, less nausea."

"Good, good. I'm due for a checkup," Clara told him. "Overdue, actually. The clinic wants me back. The trouble is--"

"What?"

"Two heartbeats. They told me last time there was some possibility it was twins. They were unsure, but. Yeah." She met the Doctor's eyes and they nodded to each other.

"Yeah. Won't do."

"I need checkups. Make sure I'm doing okay. Blood counts. All that."

The Doctor made a complicated gesture that ended in a shrug.

"UNIT?" Clara said. "They like you. They know about aliens. They won't freak out."

"I don't trust UNIT," The Doctor shook his head. "The Brigadier was a friend, but Kate has been very high-handed with me. I think she'd help, if asked. But they're soldiers."

Clara was not entirely in agreement with him, but also not ready to argue just yet. She'd keep UNIT up her sleeve, just in case anything started going wrong. "So what do we do?"

"Rely on the TARDIS." He looked somewhat consternated about this prospect, which did not please her.

She dug into the sack for more chips, but she'd eaten them all. And her hands were greasy. And she really ought to shower and dress. How much time did she have?

She yelped. "Oh, dammit, I'm late. There's no way I'm going to get to class on time without riding the bike and--"

"No riding the bike."

"Late!"

The Doctor pointed at the TARDIS. Apparently all his rules about no joyriding, no using it to be on time for things, and no frivolous trips were, as she'd always suspected, complete nonsense. He spun her off to her classroom in the TARDIS, which deposited her in place five minutes before they'd left, which meant she was early to work, which pleased her no end. How women without time machines managed pregnancy and work, she had no idea.

***

The morning conversation had been prescient, for UNIT settled the question for them that very afternoon. UNIT sent Osgood, not Kate Stewart or anyone in uniform. They sent her to Coal Hill, where Osgood presented the ID of the parent of one of her students. She was, Clara noted, wearing a black leather coat that came down almost to her knees, a dark jumper, and sturdy shoes.

"Hi," she said. "Miss Oswald. I'd like a moment of your time, if I could." She waved and smiled.

"Sure," Clara said. She didn't have a choice, and besides, she liked Osgood. They'd probably counted on that. She shut the door of her classroom, because why be overheard? Back to her desk, sit down, because Osgood looked nervous and that wasn't good. She wanted the extra authority that being behind a desk gave her.

Osgood shoved her hands deep into her jacket pockets and fidgeted with something there. "There's no particularly polite way to put this," she said.

"I never like conversations that start this way," Clara said. She picked up a pen and spun it on her thumb.

"We, um, monitor people of interest to UNIT and to, um, the Doctor."

The pen fell. Clara felt herself get very very still. She knew this feeling. Fight or flight. Adrenaline rush next. "You monitor me."

"Yeah. Sorry. It's just safer that way."

"Safer," Clara said.

"For you as well as for everybody around you. You tend to attract attention from otherworldly entities."

"You have a point there."

"It also helps us keep track of where the Doctor is, in case we need him. We have ways of signaling him but they're less reliable than the ways he gives you."

"Is this all a polite, roundabout way of telling me that you want me to signal him? Because can do." Clara pulled her cellphone out of her jacket pocket and held it up. Her hands were steadier than she had anticipated.

"No. This is a polite, roundabout way of asking you if you're carrying his child. Because that's what I think is happening."

There it was, the rush, the tremble in her hands. Fight, that was the reaction she had more often than not these days. Fight. Run into the danger, not out. Osgood, she reminded herself, was not about to attack her. Maybe. Temporize.

"Why would you think that?"

"Well, you're pregnant, and there is a cradle in your bedroom with an orrery over it for a solar system that isn't this one, with Gallifreyan writing on it. The conclusion was easy to draw."

Clara stared. The amount of anger she was feeling was really quite impressive. She wondered with one tiny corner of her mind if it was safe for the baby to be this angry. Her hand was shaking more than a little on the phone. Osgood saw it, because she grimaced and pulled out her inhaler. Breathed in, tucked it away.

"To be honest we were surprised to learn you're, um, sexually involved, because it's unusual for the Doctor. We've always thought of him as being too alien to be interested in sexual activity, despite his penchant for traveling with, um, pretty younger women."

In other circumstances that all by itself would have enraged her, but Clara was stuck on the more important issue. "You bugged my bedroom."

"Years ago now. When you were with the Maitlands. The Director at the time insisted. Director Stewart did not discontinue the program. If it's any consolation, I just found out today. When they asked me to do this. I'm not happy either, Miss Oswald. Clara."

Clara nodded tightly. Not Osgood's fault; noted. When she had the Doctor dismantle UNIT, they'd spare Osgood. "Why?"

"There are beings in this universe who'd target you the instant they learned you're the Doctor's friend. If they learn you're carrying his child--"

"And you think he's not capable of protecting me?"

"We think he'll protect you, yes. We're just not sure he'd protect anything else."

There it was again, adrenaline. Not good. Definitely not good. Clara closed her eyes, saw red, saw destruction. She breathed in, out.

"Get out of here right now or I will make so much noise you'll never be able to set foot on school grounds again."

"That won't help. We'll just wipe their memories if we need to. Miss Oswald, Clara, I am not your enemy. Truly."

"You might not think you are, but you're snooping in my bedroom. I am really angry right now and trust me, you do not want me angry at you."

Osgood nodded. "Ms Stewart thought you'd say that. You have my number, I think. Please call me if you need anything. I mean that sincerely."

"And you can sincerely stick your bugs where the sun doesn't-- Never mind. Just get out."

Osgood left, shoulders drooping, the very image of genuine misery. Clara sat at her desk, ignoring all the work she had to do, trying to calm down. Thinking through the implications. UNIT kept an eye on her. That she wasn't shocked by. The bug in her bedroom, that was shocking. The revelation that they knew which ones of his previous friends the Doctor had slept with, that was also shocking. He hadn't spent time with River Song on earth, had he? He'd spent a lot of time with the Ponds, but that had been different. They had a bug in her bedroom.

She pressed the button on her phone that contacted the Doctor. As was typical these days, he answered almost immediately. "Clara! Done with the remedial teaching yet?"

"Doctor. Osgood was just here. UNIT."

A moment of silence. "You sound upset."

"I am upset. They bugged my bedroom."

"You at home? No, I see you're in your classroom. One tick."

The TARDIS groaned into being in a corner of her classroom a moment later. The Doctor ran out, looked around, looked to her.

"She's gone," Clara said. "She's not to blame anyway. It's UNIT."

The Doctor heaved out a long sigh. "It's my fault, I think. Kate sent me a message a week ago, asking to talk to me. I told her to leave us alone or I'd be most cross. I may have said one or two other things." He looked at her, then away, a little shame-faced.

"What did you say?"

Now he looked sullen. "Nothing worth repeating."

"Oh. Well. That explains it."

"Explains what?"

"Why Osgood assumed we're involved."

"Involved? We're not involved, as I understand the word."

Clara bit her lip. "Think about it what it looks like. I'm pregnant with your child and you are acting hyper-protective and refusing to let them get anywhere near me."

The Doctor huffed. "I'm just doing what any reasonable man would do in this situation! Taking care of his-- that is, taking care of--"

"What? His what?"

"His, his--"

"The mother of his child. You can say it."

"No! That's not all. You're, you're-- you're everything. My everything."

He whirled around so his back was to her. He walked to the window of her classroom. He'd shoved his hands into his trouser pockets. Clara drifted up behind him. Rain on the windows, rain on the playground below them, puddles all over the chessboard. No one sensible would play chess on that board. Autumn rain, the trees with yellowing leaves. Their baby would be born in August of next year.

He said, in a calmer voice, "I'll tell UNIT to bugger off. I'll set up a warning system around your flat, and sweep for their bugs. You needn't worry about being spied on any longer."

Clara laid her hand on his back, flat. Wool coat, tense bow-string of a man underneath it. He was almost quivering, he was so tight.  Silence between them. The dwindling noise of the school, as children and teachers left for the day. Rain spattered on the window, driven by a gust of wind.

"This is a bad idea," he said, into the silence.

Clara flinched. Was he having second thoughts? "Why is it a bad idea?"

"Because I'm selfish."

"You're not!"

"I am," he said, quietly. "Deeply selfish. You-- you're in danger because of me. UNIT is right. But that's the least of it. Cataclysmic danger! We cope with that every day. It's boring. This! This will sow chaos and destruction in its wake, and I feel--"

"How do you feel?"

"So happy I might burst."

Clara leaned on the windowsill next to him. Cool air from outside filtered around the window in its casing. The memories, the memories came floating back sometimes, fragments of that night. The way the room had spun, the way her whole body had felt alive and tingling, the way his hands on her skin had felt. He'd been behind her for a least some of it, behind her, buried deep inside her, biting at her shoulders. Did he remember it in flashes? Clara thought it was possible he remembered every little bit of it but was pretending not to, to spare them both.

Spare them? Stint them, more like. There was no point waiting. No point protecting yourself. If you did, you would just be protecting yourself from living. So, Clara Oswald, take the chance. Tell the father of your child what was what.

"Doctor," she said, softly.

"Clara."

"I feel the same way. About both things. Our son. You."

"Oh." Some of that tension left him. He smiled at her, one of those heart-stopping smiles that sometimes lit him up. A moment of transfiguration, then he was biting at his thumb.

"Are you going to be okay coming to teach without protection?"

"I think they won't mess with you. Come on. Let's get my bedroom de-UNITed."

He slipped himself into bed with her that night exactly as on all the previous nights, under a simulated Milky Way shimmering with light and color. This time Clara was tense, wondering what would happen. It was fraught, this time. He'd said what he'd said; she'd said it back; there was only one way to understand it. He hadn't said it head on, no, and neither had she. They weren't the kind of people who'd do that. But he was frighteningly intelligent and he had to have thought through everything.

He curled up behind her, as he'd been doing, tucked an arm around her, and let a hand rest over her belly. Protective. Affectionate. She'd have hesitated to say "loving" before today, but now she knew it was the right word. She rested her hand over his, and let her fingers stroke his. Gently, because she didn't want to spook him.

"Clara," he said. Voice so soft, so rough, like heavy silk.

She stilled her fingers. "Doctor."

"What happened between us, that night. I don't remember it. But--"

"But?"

"I'm glad it happened. I'm selfish, I know it, but I'm glad." His lips brushed against the back of her neck, lingered. He made a little sound, said something into her skin, something that she didn't think was English, that the TARDIS did not translate. It didn't need to.
