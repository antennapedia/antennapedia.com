## A restaurant

Malcolm knelt in the corner of his office before the little shrine he kept. Everyone kept one, in their homes and their offices, but he in particular was expected to. Needed to. The shrine to the Blessed. To the fucking cumsack who caused people like him to exist. He supposed he ought to be grateful, but it hadn't done him all that much good. It was almost a curse, this awareness he had. Well, fuck it, do the ritual. Daily ritual, that was good. You had to do that. He reached inside, found his spiritual self, and manifested his wings. He burned the pinch of copal incense, head bowed. He was a sorry mess right now and he knew it. The election was coming. He hadn't been home, properly home, in days. He had been neglecting himself for the sake of the nation. Or at least what he thought was the good of the nation. The condition of his wings told another story. He was a fuck-up.

The door creaked open and his heart leapt into his throat. Hadn't he locked it? Sam had gone home, hadn't she?

"Malcolm, I've got an idea and-- oh my god."

Malcolm slumped forward onto his hands. Fucking Nicola fucking Murray fuck fuck fuck. He'd kept his secret quiet from everyone but Sam for fucking *years* and one time -- one fucking time-- he forgot to lock his door she found him.

Well, could have been worse. Could have been Reeder.

Fuck.

He waited for her reaction. How many seconds of gawping? What level of blindingly obvious commentary?

"You're one of the Blessed."

There it was. "Fucking amazing observation there."

"What happened to your wings? They're a mess! You're a mess. Malcolm, were you injured? They're not supposed to look like that."

Suddenly she was behind him and he felt her hand on his back.

"Don't fucking touch them!"

He shoved himself to his feet and spun around, hands raised to ward her off. He couldn't abide them being touched by anyone but an intimate partner. The idea of Nicola touching them made him sick with anger. Fucking pilgrims, treating him like he was a relic.

"You need-- you need to preen them. Or get help preening them. My oldest has a cockatoo. I know how this works." Nicola laughed and Malcolm held his head in his hands.

"Yeah. I'm a fucking cockatoo. Fuck you, Nicola. That's not how it works."

"No? Are you molting?"

"I'm not fucking *molting.* I'm fucking exhausted and malnourished and I haven't had a full night's sleep in three years and my fucking wings are like Dorian Grey's fucking portrait, got it? They're me. Fucking spiritually. That's how it fucking works. I run around mopping up the floods of piss you stream out on the nation and lose a fucking feather for every hack I threaten to garrote."

"Malcolm, I--" Then Nicola stopped and seemed to look at him properly for the first time. "Malnourished?"

"Oh fucking fuck off, Nicola. I haven't got time for this shite."

"Yes, you do. There's a Carluccio's at Waterloo Station. We're going. Put on your coat."

There was steel in her voice, unexpected steel. Malcolm wanted to resist almost reflexively except for the shock of it. Then he said, "Fucking Carluccio's?"

"It's unassuming and it's public and cheap. We can get a plate of pasta into you without anybody thinking the least of it."

Malcolm tilted his head. It was the least stupid thing Nicola had ever said to him. She was an academic. Had been. There was a brain in there somewhere. And suddenly he longed for something that wasn't this office, was a boring chain restaurant filled with people who weren't politicians talking about things that weren't about this election he was going to lose for his Party.

"Yeah," he said. "One condition. We don't fucking talk about politics."

Nicola smiled at him. "Done. Put your coat on."

Malcolm spread his arms and closed his eyes and begged the things to hide themselves. He felt them shifting, shimmering out of manifestation, his body returning to normal. The sense of the other world was always with him, as it was with all the sad fucks afflicted with a manifestation, but it was dimmer now.

"That was-- that was almost beautiful. I've been with the Minister of Spirituality on an exorcism, but that's the closest I've been to-- They say they're all around us. Angels. I never realized."

Malcolm made no reply to that, because the only things he could think to say were cruel and he found himself too weary to be cruel to Nicola. The woman was trying to feed him. The least he could do it be polite.

In the restaurant, he demanded a quiet table in the corner, where they could talk without being overheard by too many people. She would want to grill him, and he would have to answer, and the thought of it being public made him weary. He could imagine the headlines. The devil of Whitehall. The demon. Never mind that he was certified Blessed.

Nicola was prattling on at him, but he wasn't paying the least attention. Where had his life gone so very wrong? He was going to lose this election. He was losing his grace. He was a worthless sack of skin.

"Malcolm?"

Nicola and the waiter were both looking at him. "What?"

"Malcolm, would you like to split a bottle of wine? White, I think."

"Don't drink," he said, shortly. He wasn't interested in going into it with Nicola Murray.

"Pellegrino, then," she said to the waiter. "Big bottle." And then she proceeded to order for the pair of them, showing more confidence in that exchange with wait staff than she'd ever displayed as a politician with the public. How had she ever managed to get elected? She must have given speeches with some sort of grace.

Malcolm played with his salad fork and re-evaluated Nicola Murray. Could there be something useful in there after all?

"So," she said. "No politics."

"Nice to get a break from the usual, yeah?"

"If either of us knows any other topics. I can't exactly chit-chat about the football."

"You're not expected to."

"No." And there was a little bitterness in that. "I'm expected to talk about the kids. Or marriage. Or how I manage to juggle it all. No one ever asks the fathers those questions."

"Fuck that."

"Precisely. So. You're an angel, but you hide it."

Malcolm winced. "Not my word for myself. The government's word."

"I know the classifications. I also know you're rare."

"The only ones rarer are the ones with the fucking halos."

"Saints."

"Cure you with a touch. Britain's got three. One of them refuses to talk to anybody from the government." Malcolm couldn't blame her. One too many attempts to strong-arm her into performing miracles on nauseating people. You couldn't make a saint do anything they didn't want to. You *could* kill them. People had. There were consequences, but people still did it every so often. Putin had tried it. That had worked out as well as ever.

"How many like you?"

Malcolm shrugged. "You can read the census if you care. It's not like we're useful. I look impressive when I'm in good condition. Scare the kids into good behavior."

"Can you fly?"

"Yes, I can fucking fly. It does me sod-all good."

The waiter reappeared with a basket of bread and a dish of olives. The bread smelled good despite his disdain. He took a piece, broke it, ate. It was good. The focaccia was warm and the olive oil decent. Malcolm found himself working steadily through all of it while Nicola watched him with a faint smile on her face.

"When's the last time you ate?" Nicola said.

Malcolm stopped, tilted his head, considered. "Two nights ago? Sam brought me something. I forget what it was." He'd been fasting. He'd forgotten why. Some transgression he'd wanted to make good on. Pointlessly. He'd eaten whatever Sam had brought him and forgotten it instantly. Some atonement it had been. He was a fuck-up.

Nicola nodded, and took an olive. "When did you find out? About your condition."

"Puberty. Same as any other manifestation. Surprised everyone to see them. I think they expected bat wings and horns."

"Your feathers are white normally?"

"Yeah."

"Clear marker of blessedness."

"Yeah. So they didn't try to purge me. Sent me to the school instead."

"Malcolm Tucker at a school for the Blessed, my my."

"Yeah. Only fucking way to get ahead if you don't have money, at least in Thatcher's Britain."

"Is running down Thatcher talking politics? Because I could do that all day if allowed."

Malcolm grinned at her, nodded. Nicola smiled back and drank some fizzy water. Malcolm ate an olive. He was beginning to feel like he was almost human again, which was impossible given how long he'd been fasting.

Their food arrived, and Malcolm was now eager enough that he dug into his pasta. She'd ordered something safe for him, a lot of veg and cream sauce, and he ate without thinking. An act of kindness, of grace, given completely thoughtlessly and selflessly to one of the Blessed. This was meaningful. He wasn't sure how yet. He looked up and saw her smiling at him gently over her water glass.

"Fuck," he said. "Thanks. Nicola. Needed this."

"You're quite welcome."

"Don't think it'll save you next time you're colossally stupid on telly."

"Wouldn't dream of it. Eat your pasta."

"Fuck off." But he picked up his fork again anyway.

"Are they better now?"

"Better?"

"Your, um, wings."

"Oh." Malcolm reached into himself, examined his soul. To his surprise, the answer was yes. "Not great, but yeah. Yeah. Better. Fuck me." And he smiled at her.

## On sacred ground

Malcolm wandered. He wanted a church. London was full of churches, of course, full of little incense-smoked houses of the holy, shrines to the Blessed who walked among them. London, littered with immanence. Not as much as Rome was, but they'd made a go of it, the English had. Statues to the mighty ones, the Blessed heroes who'd won the Empire. Mostly the dead Blessed. The living ones were inconveniences. Like him. A fucking inconvenience as a boy, an object of wonder what what he'd been cursed with not who he was as a teenager. And now he was valued only for his capacity for terror.

Into the Tube at Westminster, out at Bank. He could get himself there in much less time, of course, but he didn't want to. He wanted to stay away from his office for a few hours. Straighten out his head. If it was possible. St Paul's was always tempting, because it was so pretty. But Christopher Wren had built other churches in London, and it was to one of these he went now.

He knew when he stepped onto sanctified ground. Had always known it, even before he'd manifested as a thirteen-year-old snot. It wasn't always where ordinary humans intended it to be, but instead where they'd made it be, through their faith. One act of faith in a place was sometimes enough. Many acts, through the centuries, in a church this lovely? He knew it. This place was real. Felt it grow as he trudged up the steps. Felt the call to show himself as he stepped over the threshold, to be who he was.

He could control it if he wished to, could keep himself hidden. But instead he allowed himself to respond to the call, and revealed himself half-way. Wings, feathered wings, a huge span, shimmering with spiritual light, translucent in the sunlight because he had not allowed himself out fully. They were looking better since his meal with Nicola Murray. A few of his flight feathers had reappeared overnight. They were still gray, stained with black spots and what might have looked like dried blood if he'd dared look, but they had returned. He had done something right in that conversation, had pleased whatever power it was that had done this to him. The power humans gave many names to and built these shrines for.

What did it mean? He'd never understood. It wasn't like with birds, as he'd so nastily told Nicola; it was something from that other world that nestled alongside theirs. He'd been snowy white on Tom's election night, and he'd already said horrible things to worthless people. Been blind drunk before the night was out. Awakened with his head pounding, on the floor of his front hallway, vomit down the front of his boiled shirt, and still his wings had been unstained.

Malcolm stood on hallowed ground and spread his wings, still half-insubstantial, revealed himself as one of the Blessed.

If you caught him in an unguarded moment, he might admit that he liked the feeling of manifesting himself, of letting himself bask in the safety and sense of belonging that a church gave him. The bow the verger made as she came up to him and asked what they might do for His Grace. The title made him frown, as it always had. He'd done nothing to earn it. He had merely existed. But he politely asked if he might spend a few minutes at the altar. Of course he was welcome. This way, your grace, and the bow again, with a gesture in the right direction, though not a soul could miss the thing, bathed as it was in sunlight in the center of the church.

He paused at the votive rack to buy a candle. Light it with another candle. Burn a pinch of incense with it. Stand before the altar. Henry Moore, marble, with two huge candles set upon it, had caused a fuss at the time it had been dedicated. Nothing had ever been sacrificed here, no blood shed that was not merely symbolic. It was still a powerful place.

He laid a hand on the altar, let himself feel that power. The connection with the being that had made him. Felt what he'd feared he'd feel: Judgement. He was a fuck-up. He hadn't managed to make good on anything he'd done. He could feel it resonating within, an angry buzz against his skin. A fuck-up first to last.

"I don't know what you want," he said. "You made me this, and I know I have to do something. But fucking what? How am I supposed to know?"

Malcolm manifested himself fully and spread his wings wide. Beat them once, twice. Watched the candle flames flicker and fight and flutter out. He closed his eyes, concentrated, and every candle in the church came alight again. He had a flaming sword. Or he could have one when he needed one. He never needed one.

He was a messenger. That was what angels were. You could entrust a message to him and he would deliver it as no other being could. The concepts were slippery but the principle held. He could write a speech like few could. He could tell a minister that he was sacked in exactly the way the PM wanted it said. He could vanish and move invisibly and inhumanly fast. He could fly. He made one hell of a communications director.

A communications director for a craven, greedy twat. Succor the poor. Wash their feet. Ha.

He folded his wings again, neatly against his back. He could see a man in a dog collar approaching, unremarkable otherwise, older, a little pudgy. The rector, then, come to fawn at the feet of the Blessed celebrity visitor. A boon to the church, which was already a minor tourist spot. People would come here if they thought one of the Blessed could be seen. Malcolm controlled his rage, his impatience. It was natural; they didn't know he was a fuck-up. See the pretty angel with the pretty wings. Beg for a blessing.

"I apologize for disturbing you," the rector said. "It's rare we are graced with the open presence of an angel, and I-- well, I had to say a word." He had a lovely voice, all Oxford plums and brandy, a nice soothing treat.

"Yeah, no bother. I come here often. You've got a beautiful church."

"Oh! Oh. We hadn't, that is, I haven't seen you here or I'd have paid respects."

"I don't show myself, as a rule." Malcolm gestured to his wings. His poor bedraggled wings, all gray and stained and broken. He spread them again, insolently wide, so that the rector might see and quail and shrink away and fuck off.

The man's face changed; he stretched out a hand and stopped short of touching him. His fingers curled, and then he did touch Malcolm's arm for an instant.

"Sir, has something terrible happened to you? I-- My goodness."

Malcolm's first impulse was to say something to set the man back on his heels, ensure he'd never speak to him again. Then he remembered Nicola looking at him with such guileless sympathy, pouring him a glass of fizzy water and simply talking to him, and he held onto the invective. Looked at the man again. Read him, saw that he was a sensitive. Born to the priesthood, then, not merely in it for the living.

Malcolm said, with real curiosity, "How do you know I didn't do something terrible?"

The rector made a dismissive gesture and shook his head. "It was a sin. Whatever it was that was done to you."

At that moment Malcolm understood it to be true. It was a sin for him to have even considered being horrible to a harmless old man. It was a sin to scream at unworthy politicians. But it was also a sin to demand that an angel scream. And Tom knew what he was; had sought him out because of what he was.

He looked at the great candles burning, at the incense plumes rising in the sunlight, and his blood turned to water in his veins. Tom. Tom. What had Tom said, when he'd recruited Malcolm? It was important now that he remember. A casual threat, a lighted cigarette, a bottle that Malcolm had been far too willing to drain. What had he said?

The rector was still talking. Malcolm shook himself back to attention.

"May I ask your grace's name?"

"It's Malcolm. Just Malcolm."

He held out his hand, thinking to shake the rector's, but was dismayed to see him take it and bow over it, kiss the air over his knuckles as if he were the Pope or the fucking Dalai Lama, one of the great mystical Blessed Ones who told the rest of the fucks how to live.

"I'll pray for you, Malcolm," the rector said.

Another act of kindness, this one done with awareness of its meaning, but still kindly offered from a kind man. Malcolm had always been able to be gracious in response to real human beings.

"Thank you. You've been helpful. You, yeah, there'll always be at least one candle burning here from now on. Fucking, um, that one." Malcolm pointed at the candle he'd lit. From now until he lost his grace utterly, at which time his stained, sodden miracles would be undone, but Malcolm wouldn't go into that.

He moved then, inhumanly fast, before the rector could respond, and was out of the church. Spread his wings and leapt and was in the air, a blur, a rush of wind. To the dome of the church, to the gutter that rimmed it. He landed, crouched, wings out level at his sides. The City below him, the Bank of England, the men in pinstripes, cars droning below, pigeons cooing on the roof beside him. The spring breeze, the blue sky, the scudding clouds, the sunlight and shadows moving around him. An angel in full manifestation in the City in broad daylight. Would any of them look up to see? If he topped himself now would any of them notice?

He'd long since worked out how he'd do it. Craft the perfect message to send to Tom, to the press, and scribe it in his hallowed blood. Mail it. And then drive himself into the earth at Mach 10. One of his fellows had done that at Tunguska a century ago. Had made quite a noise. It would work, though. There were other ways. The missile approach would be noticed.

The only thing that kept him from it some days was his unwillingness to let the cunts win. If he gave up, they'd have the last laugh at him. No legacy, no children, no lovers, no life, no one to defend him after he was gone. A few political victories from when he'd been up north, which other men would take credit for. That was fine; he didn't need his name to survive him.

Nothing kept him from it today. He didn't even want to leave a message. He'd let the fuck do this to him. Tom had made him swear to serve him on pain of his grace. And yet he was to blame. He'd let himself slip, been open to it.

His pocket buzzed. The pattern meant it was Jamie. He took out his phone and thumbed it alive. "Yeah?"

"Did you know that Nicola Murray is on the radio right and she doesn't sound like a cunting moron?"

Malcolm smiled, actually smiled. "A fucking miracle," he said.

"Shit, don't tell me you did this."

"By means of some choice edits to her original shite prep briefing."

"Why the fuck did you do that? I thought you wanted her to turf."

"Changed my fucking mind, didn't I."

Silence for a while. Odd noises in the background. Jamie had, he thought, called him from the bog. Malcolm grimaced. Jamie was incorrigible. He thought about bollocking him for it, then lost interest. There was no point bollocking anybody for anything any more.

"You okay, Malc?"

Silence for a moment. Malcolm watched a red bus stop below him, people get on and off. Little people. Humans. Not like him. "Not really."

"Where are you?"

"On the roof of a fuckin' church."

Silence. Then, "Which church?"

"Walbrook."

"Fucking poncey taste you have. Malc."

"Fuck you, too."

"You're due in a meeting with me and fucking Mannion in five minutes. He's got some cunting advertisement scheme he wants to spend a few million quid on to support the council houses knock-down thing."

"This isn't helping," Malcolm said, and then he fell silent. He'd just given the game away. Not that Jamie hadn't understood already. He looked down at the street below. Not far enough to reliably kill him, probably. Fuck. He'd have to do the high-speed thing. Not here, though. He'd take out innocents if he did that. There were still innocents in the Square Mile, somewhere. One or two.

"Malc. You still there?"

"Yeah. Tell Mannion to fuck himself."

"Yeah, I'll handle it. Look. Shelly's out at her mam's with the kids tonight. Was going to do a fry-up but then I thought, I'll get Malcolm to cook."

"Is this how you'll be doing it?"

"I'm going to handle Mannion then I'm going to come round your office and you're going to be in it. And then we'll go at it, Motherwell rules. And then when I've pummeled sense into your thick head you'll take me to yours and cook something posh for the two of us. And that's how I'll be doing it."

Malcolm scrubbed his hand over his face. Suddenly he was too tired to do anything, too tired to care, too tired even to think. "Can't be arsed with the fighting."

"Just get yerself over to the office. And stop making Sam anxious about you, yeah? She called me. Hate it when that happens."

"Okay."

"See you do it."

And then the call went dead. Malcolm slipped the phone into his breast pocket and stood. London, giddy busy London, below him. If he was here much longer someone would see him. Take photos of him. Angel spotted on church roof. Splattered over Instagram; liked on Facebook. Fuck that. He spread his wings and moved, invisibly, into the air. Used the gift that was his to use as he saw fit, the gift that had been entrusted to him, to slide silently and swiftly through London's skies, from the seat of money to the seat of power, down, to the entrance of his offices.
