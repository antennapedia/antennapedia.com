Malcolm knelt in the corner of his office before the little shrine he kept. Everyone kept one, in their homes and their offices, but he in particular was expected to. Needed to. The shrine to the Blessed. To the fucking cumsack who caused people like him to exist. He supposed he ought to be grateful, but it hadn't done him all that much good. It was almost a curse, this awareness he had. Well, fuck it, do the ritual. Daily ritual, that was good. You had to do that. He reached inside, found his spiritual self, and manifested his wings. He burned the pinch of copal incense, head bowed. He was a sorry mess right now and he knew it. The election was coming. He hadn't been home, properly home, in days. He had been neglecting himself for the sake of the nation. Or at least what he thought was the good of the nation. The condition of his wings told another story. He was a fuck-up.

The door creaked open and his heart leapt into his throat. Hadn't he locked it? Sam had gone home, hadn't she?

"Malcolm, I've got an idea and-- oh my god."

Malcolm slumped forward onto his hands. Fucking Nicola fucking Murray fuck fuck fuck. He'd kept his secret quiet from everyone but Sam for fucking *years* and one time -- one fucking time-- he forgot to lock his door she found him.

Well, could have been worse. Could have been Reeder.

Fuck.

He waited for her reaction. How many seconds of gawping? What level of blindingly obvious commentary?

"You're one of the Blessed."

There it was. "Fucking amazing observation there."

"What happened to your wings? They're a mess! You're a mess. Malcolm, were you injured? They're not supposed to look like that."

Suddenly she was behind him and he felt her hand on his back.

"Don't fucking touch them!"

He shoved himself to his feet and spun around, hands raised to ward her off. He couldn't abide them being touched by anyone but an intimate partner. The idea of Nicola touching them made him sick with anger. Fucking pilgrims, treating him like he was a relic.

"You need-- you need to preen them. Or get help preening them. My oldest has a cockatoo. I know how this works." Nicola laughed and Malcolm held his head in his hands.

"Yeah. I'm a fucking cockatoo. Fuck you, Nicola. That's not how it works."

"No? Are you molting?"

"I'm not fucking *molting.* I'm fucking exhausted and malnourished and I haven't had a full night's sleep in three years and my fucking wings are like Dorian Grey's fucking portrait, got it? They're me. Fucking spiritually. That's how it fucking works. I run around mopping up the floods of piss you stream out on the nation and lose a fucking feather for every hack I threaten to garrote."

"Malcolm, I--" Then Nicola stopped and seemed to look at him properly for the first time. "Malnourished?"

"Oh fucking fuck off, Nicola. I haven't got time for this shite."

"Yes, you do. There's a Carluccio's at Waterloo Station. We're going. Put on your coat."

There was steel in her voice, unexpected steel. Malcolm wanted to resist almost reflexively except for the shock of it. Then he said, "Fucking Carluccio's?"

"It's unassuming and it's public and cheap. We can get a plate of pasta into you without anybody thinking the least of it."

Malcolm tilted his head. It was the least stupid thing Nicola had ever said to him. She was an academic. Had been. There was a brain in there somewhere. And suddenly he longed for something that wasn't this office, was a boring chain restaurant filled with people who weren't politicians talking about things that weren't about this election he was going to lose for his Party.

"Yeah," he said. "One condition. We don't fucking talk about politics."

Nicola smiled at him. "Done. Put your coat on."

Malcolm spread his arms and closed his eyes and begged the things to hide themselves. He felt them shifting, shimmering out of manifestation, his body returning to normal. The sense of the other world was always with him, as it was with all the sad fucks afflicted with a manifestation, but it was dimmer now.

"That was-- that was almost beautiful. I've been with the Minister of Spirituality on an exorcism, but that's the closest I've been to-- They say they're all around us. Angels. I never realized."

Malcolm made no reply to that, because the only things he could think to say were cruel and he found himself too weary to be cruel to Nicola. The woman was trying to feed him. The least he could do it be polite.

In the restaurant, he demanded a quiet table in the corner, where they could talk without being overheard by too many people. She would want to grill him, and he would have to answer, and the thought of it being public made him weary. He could imagine the headlines. The devil of Whitehall. The demon. Never mind that he was certified Blessed.

Nicola was prattling on at him, but he wasn't paying the least attention. Where had his life gone so very wrong? He was going to lose this election. He was losing his grace. He was a worthless sack of skin.

"Malcolm?"

Nicola and the waiter were both looking at him. "What?"

"Malcolm, would you like to split a bottle of wine? White, I think."

"Don't drink," he said, shortly. He wasn't interested in going into it with Nicola Murray.

"Pellegrino, then," she said to the waiter. "Big bottle." And then she proceeded to order for the pair of them, showing more confidence in that exchange with wait staff than she'd ever displayed as a politician with the public. How had she ever managed to get elected? She must have given speeches with some sort of grace.

Malcolm played with his salad fork and re-evaluated Nicola Murray. Could there be something useful in there after all?

"So," she said. "No politics."

"Nice to get a break from the usual, yeah?"

"If either of us knows any other topics. I can't exactly chit-chat about the football."

"You're not expected to."

"No." And there was a little bitterness in that. "I'm expected to talk about the kids. Or marriage. Or how I manage to juggle it all. No one ever asks the fathers those questions."

"Fuck that."

"Precisely. So. You're an angel, but you hide it."

Malcolm winced. "Not my word for myself. The government's word."

"I know the classifications. I also know you're rare."

"The only ones rarer are the ones with the fucking halos."

"Saints."

"Cure you with a touch. Britain's got three. One of them refuses to talk to anybody from the government." Malcolm couldn't blame her. One too many attempts to strong-arm her into performing miracles on nauseating people. You couldn't make a saint do anything they didn't want to. You *could* kill them. People had. There were consequences, but people still did it every so often. Putin had tried it. That had worked out as well as ever.

"How many like you?"

Malcolm shrugged. "You can read the census if you care. It's not like we're useful. I look impressive when I'm in good condition. Scare the kids into good behavior."

"Can you fly?"

"Yes, I can fucking fly. It does me sod-all good."

The waiter reappeared with a basket of bread and a dish of olives. The bread smelled good despite his disdain. He took a piece, broke it, ate. It was good. The focaccia was warm and the olive oil decent. Malcolm found himself working steadily through all of it while Nicola watched him with a faint smile on her face.

"When's the last time you ate?" Nicola said.

Malcolm stopped, tilted his head, considered. "Two nights ago? Sam brought me something. I forget what it was." He'd been fasting. He'd forgotten why. Some transgression he'd wanted to make good on. Pointlessly. He'd eaten whatever Sam had brought him and forgotten it instantly. Some atonement it had been. He was a fuck-up.

Nicola nodded, and took an olive. "When did you find out? About your condition."

"Puberty. Same as any other manifestation. Surprised everyone to see them. I think they expected bat wings and horns."

"Your feathers are white normally?"

"Yeah."

"Clear marker of blessedness."

"Yeah. So they didn't try to purge me. Sent me to the school instead."

"Malcolm Tucker at a school for the Blessed, my my."

"Yeah. Only fucking way to get ahead if you don't have money, at least in Thatcher's Britain."

"Is running down Thatcher talking politics? Because I could do that all day if allowed."

Malcolm grinned at her, nodded. Nicola smiled back and drank some fizzy water. Malcolm ate an olive. He was beginning to feel like he was almost human again, which was impossible given how long he'd been fasting.

Their food arrived, and Malcolm was now eager enough that he dug into his pasta. She'd ordered something safe for him, a lot of veg and cream sauce, and he ate without thinking. An act of kindness, of grace, given completely thoughtlessly and selflessly to one of the Blessed. This was meaningful. He wasn't sure how yet. He looked up and saw her smiling at him gently over her water glass.

"Fuck," he said. "Thanks. Nicola. Needed this."

"You're quite welcome."

"Don't think it'll save you next time you're colossally stupid on telly."

"Wouldn't dream of it. Eat your pasta."

"Fuck off." But he picked up his fork again anyway.

"Are they better now?"

"Better?"

"Your, um, wings."

"Oh." Malcolm reached into himself, examined his soul. To his surprise, the answer was yes. "Not great, but yeah. Yeah. Better. Fuck me." And he smiled at her.
