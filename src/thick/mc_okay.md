## One: Announcements

Malcolm changed into a fresh suit in his office, with the door closed and Sam guarding it. New set of clothes right down to his boxers. Thank God Sam was all business about these things, but he hadn't been home in three days and the shower (gents only) couldn't do anything for his half-melted shirts. It had been a hellish streak. Stress, shouting, tense meetings, the PM fighting for his political life, the Party in a shambles, an utter blood-soaked shambles. It was so bad he'd had to put off Clara and the dinner date she desperately wanted for three nights running.

The photograph of Clara on his desk had glass on it. Malcolm maneuvered himself around so he could see his own reflection well enough to knot his tie. Clara's face smiled up at him behind his own grimace. It made him feel like a tit. He'd make it up to her somehow, though he was fucked if he knew how. He'd had Sam send her several greenhouses of flowers, complete with groveling notes, but he knew that wasn't enough. Wasn't the way he wanted it either. She deserved his time and attention and his presence at the quiet moments, doing things like eating breakfast together, going for walks, arguing about which one of them should acquire a cat. Not just tumbling into bed every time he managed to drag himself away, for a few hours of closeness.

Not that either one of them minded the tumbling. Tumbling was great. He'd been a bit desperate the last time, and Clara had been distracted successfully from his absences, and-- Fuck. Fuck. He'd just had a brainstorm, an unwelcome moment of self-insight. He stared at himself in the glass, at Clara's face behind. He wanted a bit more than that, did he?

Fuck. No time to think this through. Time to get on with his shit-covered morning. He lunged for the door.

"Sam! Sammy!"

He yanked the door open and stopped. Clara, sitting on the edge of Sam's desk, chatting away with Sam, nineteen to the dozen. They broke off and looked up at him. Sam stood up and automatically took his soiled jacket from him. Malcolm gawped. His mind leaped around from bad explanation to worse; Clara looked a little solemn. She never came to his office except in emergencies. It was not the done thing, trotting girlfriends around to soak their knickers with displays of one's power. At least not at 10 ack emma. So therefore it was an emergency. Shit. Fuck.

"What's wrong?" he said.

Clara slid down and came toward him, not looking at him. "Thanks, Sam. Owe you one."

Now his stomach was really dropping hard and fast. He stroked a hand over his face. "Sam, tell them all to fuck off until I open the door myself, right? Ta."

Door closed, and he had Clara in his arms pressed up against it, his mouth on hers, just to prove to himself that she wasn't dumping him like the absentee cock-up he was. Then she was pushing him away, gently enough, but with definite purpose.

"Sorry, darling, I am sorry. About last night. And the night before."

"Yeah, I know. Been reading the papers."

"Blood in the fucking water, sharks circling."

"I get it. Seriously, I do get it. But I can't let this wait any longer."

"What? Clara--"

"Just shut up, okay? I have to say this." She pulled her phone out of her pocket and jabbed a finger at it. "I wrote cue cards, and then I put notes in my phone and rehearsed it. Oh my god, I can't possibly read all this. What was I thinking?"

Her eyes went wide and she stared at the screen. Malcolm made a grab for the phone, to cut the middleman out, but she swatted his hand down and tucked it back into her jacket pocket.

"Right. Okay. The thing is, and it's really a thing, not just a hypothetical thing, though it's a terrifying thing that I haven't had the courage to tell you for a week now and--" She broke off.

"What, darling? Just say it. Please. You dumping me?"

Her eyes went wide, and she reached out to rest a hand on his chest. "No. No. It's nothing like that. More the opposite."

"Then what?"

"I'm pregnant."

Malcolm slammed his hand over his mouth.

The leap in his heart, fuck him, the leap in his heart was not to be denied. He kept his hand clamped down, to prevent himself from bleating out anything before he knew how she stood, what she wanted. He'd do fucking anything for her. She was waiting for him to react, watching him. He needed to say something. He pulled his hand away cautiously, wiped it on his trouser leg. He looked carefully at Clara, who was now staring at him. He couldn't read the expression on her face to save his life.

He said, "You sure?"

"Took two tests. And a blood test."

"How long?"

"Ten weeks, maybe eleven tops."

"Fuck, when we went to Spain."

"Yeah, that weekend in Spain. Wine, beach. Too much wine."

It had been a ridiculous evening and worth the headache the next morning. He turned away because he was smiling at the memory and he felt guilty. He'd done it to her that night, one of those times on the beach or in their house after that, or -- fuck, he'd got her pregnant one of those times. Too drunk to remember the condoms.

"Say something, Malcolm. Tell me how you feel about this. It's kind of a big thing."

He rubbed his hand over his face. What to say? *Oh God yes yes my heart I am dizzy with lust right now.* Did she want to hear that? Or did she want sober steady *it's okay darling I'll back you no matter what*?

"Malcolm, I'm really scared right now."

Her voice was watery. Malcolm spun back around. Tears on her face. Shit! He lunged forward and got his arms around her.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay. You're moving in with me, mind. I've got the room for it."

"What?"

"You heard me, darling."

She shook her head. "What."

"Whatever you want."

"Even if it means becoming a father at the age of forty-five?"

"Even that. Whatever the fuck you want. I fucking mean it."

He rummaged around in his jacket pockets. Handkerchief, not his thing, but sometimes Sam stocked him up. She had. He dabbed Clara's face dry, careful to avoid the mascara. She took it from him and blew her nose.

It got to him then, the thought of it, of her with him for years and years, not just a fast affair until she got bored with him: kids, a house somewhere in Scotland, nights that were not in a dim musty building fucked full of upper-class twits. Fucking hell. Clara was pregnant. Pregnant. He'd done it. The thought of her up the duff from him, that night, that amazing wild endless warm night, fuck him, he was wild about it. Not right now, though. Maybe tonight. Maybe. If she was in the mood. Right now was she needed was a steady arm around her. He wasn't so stupid as to not know how this worked. She needed to know he was sticking around.

Malcolm went down on his knees and wrapped his arms around Clara's waist and tried not to let his own eyes sting. He turned his head and pressed an ear to her belly. "Can't hear anything."

She giggled and sniffled. "You idiot. That won't be for months yet."

"Any child of yours is bound to start making noise early."

"Oh yeah? Your kid, so it'll be shouting from the womb."

"At least she'll be gorgeous. Your nose, your dimples. My height."

Clara ran her fingers through his hair. "Could have my height and your nose."

"Don't curse it, darling."

She laughed. Okay. This was going to be okay.

## Two: Jamie

Malcolm kissed Clara at the door of his office, then walked out with her through Sam's domain to the outer door. He kissed her again there and let her fingers trail out of his as she headed off. He bit at his thumb and turned around to see Sam looking at him speculatively. He yanked his thumb out of his mouth and shoved his hands into his trouser pockets.

"Sam, yeah, look, send more roses to Clara's flat, would you? Also her classroom. Same message as always. I've got to shout at Abbot for a few, then try not to eviscerate Baldy and fuck, there's no point to it, is there?"

"You need to eat some breakfast," Sam told him, kindly enough. She handed him a tray with a coffee and a muffin on it. He took it, stared down at it. He was going to be a father, fate willing. He and Clara. A father. There was no way he was going to do that without marrying her first, was there? He was going to make an honest woman of her and an honest man of himself.

"Fuck Abbot," he said. "Baldy can fuck himself or hire a rentboy to do the fucking, I don't care which. Get Jamie here as fast as his little legs can carry him. And Sam? Yeah. Thanks, Sam. I'm gonna-- there's gonna be some things I'll need your help planning."

Sam cocked an eyebrow at him. She was considerably more intelligent than most of the politicians that shuffled in shame through his door.

"Yeah," Malcolm said. "Look, yeah, it's what you think, but I need to talk to some people first. Lips sealed, yeah?"

Jamie came by about ten minutes later, out of breath.

"What the cunting fuck is going on? Sam said top priority, which she never says."

Malcolm drew him into the inner office and shut the door.

"Yeah. So. Here's the thing. Clara's up the duff."

"Fuck." Jamie's face went dark for a moment, then it cleared of all emotion. "You need it handled quietly?"

"What? No! Fucking going to marry her. Need somebody to stand with me. Get me drunk before and then haul me to the church all green in the face."

"Malc--" And then Jamie had his arms around him and was pounding his back. Malcolm endured it, let Jamie kiss both his cheeks. "You fucking devil," he said. "No other way she would have you, huh?"

"Yeah, if she'll have me. Haven't fucking popped the question yet. She just agreed to move in, and we're raising the bairn together, but I haven't asked her this yet."

Jamie shoved him away roughly. "Get to it, man. Get out of here and go down on your worthless knee."

"Need a ring."

"Go fucking buy one. You're minted these days."

"We both are, compared to how it was."

"Yeah."

Malcolm looked at his friend, his lieutenant of so many years, and saw him for a moment as he'd been in that newspaper office, bad shoes and worse suit, tie untied, no lines on his face.

Then Jamie said, "Feel a lot better about this one than the last time."

Malcolm would have winced at that reminder of his first marriage before now. Now he didn't fucking care. He was with Clara. Clara, who was the breath in his lungs, the blood in his veins. "Yeah," he said.

"Get the fuck out of here and to a fucking jeweler. Go! I'll gut Baldy when he shows up."

## Three: Evening sickness

"I thought it was morning sickness," Malcolm said. "Mornings. Not evenings." Not during nice dinners he'd cooked for her while half out of his mind with nerves.

Clara's hair escaped from him when she shook her head, and Malcolm hastily gathered it up again, held it away from her face while she retched. She spat into the sink and said, "Right, that's it for the caprese you so thoughtfully made."

"I thought you liked tomatoes."

"I do. I guess Junior doesn't. Today. Tomorrow I'll probably want about five hundred tomatoes."

Malcolm snagged a wine glass and filled it with fizzy water. Clara drank, swished some around in her mouth, and spat into his kitchen sink again. This was all his fault. He'd done this to her.

"This is normal?"

She sighed. "Apparently it could be a lot worse. I only lose it about half the time I eat."

"I don't need to fetch a doctor?"

"No, you idiot. Am I going to have to get you a book on how this all works?"

"Fuck no, darling. I've got it under control. Just checking." Malcolm made a mental note to get Sam to recommend a good book for him so he wouldn't be caught flat-footed again. He followed at her elbow back to the table, and held her chair for her.

Clara picked up her fork and jabbed it at him. "What?"

"What do you mean, what?"

"You're hovering. Stop hovering. I don't need hovering. I'm fine. I'm hungry again, even."

"Yeah, okay, calm yer tits, darling, I'm not hovering. I just--"

"What?"

Malcolm opened his mouth, shut it, shoved his hands into his trouser pockets. In the right pocket was a little velvet box. He'd had it for days, since Jamie had shooed him out of his office to a jeweler's. He'd been carrying the damn thing in his pocket for all those days, absolutely unable to do what he needed to do with it. It was supposed to end up on her finger and then he'd have to shell out ungodly amounts of dosh for a lavish wedding. That was how it was supposed to go. But what if she didn't want him? What if the stone was wrong? How was he supposed to ask? Was he supposed to go to one knee? Both knees? Would Clara want him to do what he was supposed to do or something iconoclastic or should he just do what one of those repressed twats in one of her Austen novels would do?

He took the box out of his pocket. Went down on one knee. Snapped the box open. Held it out to her. His stomach felt about the way it did the first time he got grilled by a panel of MPs, the first time he'd watched a prime minister deliver a speech he'd written, the first time he'd bullied a minister into resigning.

"Malcolm--"

“You’re everything to me. Thought you should fuckin’ know. The world should fuckin’ know. That’s my wee bairn and I– Fuck me.” He snapped his mouth shut before he made it worse, ground his teeth, looked everywhere but at her.

“Okay.”

Malcolm's heart stopped. “Okay?”

“Yeah, okay.”

## Four: His

Sleep was a dim memory. Dreaming was a dim memory. He was wearing a t-shirt and stained track pants. He couldn't remember the last time he'd put on a tie. Thank fuck for parental leave. He'd have hated trying to terrorize idiot politicians with spit-up on his coat. Malcolm's life was nappies and walking around the house singing to a tiny thing that would spit up on his shoulder when he least expected it. He paced with wee Dougan on his shoulder so that Clara could sleep. Three weeks old. Couldn't do a thing but eat, shit, and wail. Malcolm was already wrapped around Dougan's tiny tiny finger.

The bairn was asleep at last. He tiptoed his way up the stairs and into their bedroom. Cot was by the side of their bed.  He laid Dougan down on his back and breathed out a sigh of relief. Still asleep. Sometimes he woke when set down.

Clara sat up in their bed and yawned.

"Sorry," he said. "Didn't mean to wake you."

"My turn, Malc," Clara said. "He's asleep. You sleep."

"You sure?"

"I just got in three hours. I'm good."

Malcolm needed no further invitation. He fell face-down onto the bed. His eyes were closed and he was in REM sleep before he had time to remember he hated sleeping on his stomach.

He woke some time later. Dark out, by the lights in the windows. He stretched, yawned, rolled over. Clara was standing the bed, her shirt open, wee Dougan against her breast. The sight did something to him every time, no matter how many times he'd seen it. His wife, his child. His heart aching in his chest so fiercely it was a wonder no one else could hear it whimpering.

"Come here, darling. Let me hold you. Hold both of you."

Malcolm sat up against the headboard and opened his arms to her. She scooted around to sit between his thighs. She leaned back against him until she was settled. He slipped his arms around her, found the hand she had braced under Dougan's bottom and laced his fingers with hers.

Yeah. He was a dad. This was what she'd done to his life. He had a family. He'd thought he'd die without one. No legacy, no children, nobody in his corner, but here he was, watching his son suckle. Murky gray blue eyes open, looking up his wife. His son. His wife. His. They were his. His tears on his face, dripping from the end of his nose. All his.

## Five: Father's Day

Father's Day, as an institution, was something Malcolm was indifferent to. Or claimed to be, anyway. He'd always taken time for it when his father had been alive, and he still took the time on Mother's Day every year. Or if he couldn't take the time, he ensured that something his mum liked was waiting for her on the day. He'd done the same this year, carefully planned so his much-loved mother knew how he felt. But this year, ah, this year he'd had somebody else to fuss over and make much of. This year he'd had Clara, new mother Clara, to dance attendance on, bringing her breakfast in bed and the Buck's Fizz she could have once more. He'd made the most of Mother's Day this year.

Father's Day, though, Father's Day he hadn't the time for. He expected nothing to be made of the day for his own sake. Maybe later, once Dougan was old enough to understand it. Maybe once the lad was a teen and had to be reminded his old man existed. Assuming Malcolm had the energy for it; he'd be over sixty by then. Will you still need me, will you still fucking feed me, that sort of thing.

He was a *father*. He, Malcolm Tucker, was a da. He'd won the genetic game and spawned. He had a wee one of his very own, lying asleep in his arms with a freshly-changed nappy. The little devil had pissed while he'd been changing him, which Malcolm now knew how to cope with. Fucking fiends, those boys and their piss-spigots.

Being a father meant mopping urine off his own face. And carrying out the bag full of soiled nappies. And learning how to use a thermometer that you stuck in their ear, and staying up all night fretting over that fever while giving your wife a shot at sleep.

It meant loving the fuck out of two beings instead of just one. It meant your wife waking you up on the Sunday morning with coffee and your own glass of fizz, kissing your temple and then your lips and complaining about your scratchy chin with a weekend's growth on it.

"Fuck off, darling. Or better yet, let's get the lad into his cot and we can do the other sort of fucking."

Never failed to make her laugh, his silver-fouled tongue, oh yes. Malcolm was a father, and Clara was a mother, and all was right with the world.

## Six: Barcelona

Spain. Barcelona, to be precise. Not full height of the tourist season, which never ended in Barcelona, but it was warm enough. They weren't in the city itself but east of it, on a private beach, in a house in a cluster of private guest houses. Or so Clara had pitched it to him.

A glorious sunset glowed from the west. He had his eyes turned away from it, though, and turned toward Clara's backside in a little sundress and bare legs. She turned back to him and stretched out a hand. He took it. She had the blanket; he had the wine bottle. Down the path, onto the beach, right down over onto the white, white sand. Cool under his feet, but the breeze from the Mediterranean was warm. A warm night with a moon just shy of full hovering to the east. Lights and voices and music floated dimly over the hills at the edge of the beach, but faded as they got closer to the water.

He followed Clara further down. No dunes here, just smooth beach, slanting down into the sea. It was dark, save for the moonlight on the water. Tide on the way out, a line of salty wrack at the high water mark, cold wet sand below.

Clara retreated a few feet back up and laid the blanket out. Malcolm stretched himself out next to her and held out the bottle. No glasses. He'd had the forethought to open it while they were back at the cottage.

Clara took it and giggled at him. "To us!" She took a swig and giggled again. It was adorable. "Oh, that's nice. Try it." She passed it to him.

"To us," he said, raising the stem toward the moon. "Fuck, yes, that's good. Almost sweet, but not too much."

"Sipping wine."

"For a moonlit night."

Another pass of the bottle back and forth, then he screwed it firmly into the sand by their heads. He laid a hand on her hip, leaned in, and kissed her. Wine on her lips, perfume in her hair, oh yes. This was what he'd hoped for when he'd planned this little getaway. No fucking interruptions, nothing to do in the morning but shag some more. It wasn't a five-star hotel, but it was the next best thing: a fucking gorgeous private Mediterranean beach on a fucking gorgeous evening with the most fucking gorgeous woman he'd ever kissed.

He'd already taken a fat blue pill to ensure best results for the evening-- not that he would ever admit that to her, but he did it so he could keep up-- and he had a threesome of rubbers in his pocket. The pill was good for at least three, he'd learned from previous evenings of excess with her. Clara herself was often good for more than that, but that's what God had given him a tongue for. That was running ahead of himself, though. Right now it was time to talk, and kiss, and flirt.

They'd been dating for a few months now, but this was their first time away together, and Malcolm was kicking himself for not having taken the time to do it sooner, because it was magic. Talking to her, laughing with her, sharing the bottle with her, looking into her dark eyes in the moonlight: magic. The spin doctor and the school teacher, yeah, that's what the twat at the Mirror had written, and let them write. The spin doctor's head was spinning and the school teacher had him schooled. Fuck, he was simple in the head about her.

"Malcolm?"

"Yeah?"

"You okay? You just broke off in the middle of a sentence and went glassy-eyed."

He blinked, focused on her, and grinned. "You're fucking gorgeous, you know that? And have as many brains as the entire cabinet smashed together into a single skull."

"Wow, quite an image there, but thanks."

"It's true, though." He fumbled until he'd found her hand and kissed it. "Fucking crazy about you."

"I know. I'm crazy about you too."

"Fuck knows why, but I'll take it."

"Seriously, Malcolm? Because of how much you care about everything you care about."

That made his face flush with emotion, and that wasn't something he could bear much of. So rather than answer he laid her back on the blanket, hand behind her head, and kissed her deeply. Got a knee between her thighs and settled in for the serious snogging of the evening, the snogging that would end in shagging on the beach. Fucking fantasy life he lived, a Motherwell boy in a place like this with a woman like this who was crazy about him. He was well hard now, and it felt good to press himself against her, to know she appreciated it. Appreciated him.

Clara sat up and wriggled and slid her knickers down her legs. Showed them to him for an instant, then tucked them behind herself. Malcolm lost no time getting his hand up her skirt again, let his middle finger press into her cunt while his thumb rested on her clit. Work her up fully this way, get her near coming, get her open and soft and wet, then ask her if he could fuck her, not that she'd said no to him yet. A long series of enthusiastic yeses starting with that second date. The first date he'd just kissed her at her door, all nerves and questions he wasn't ready to ask yet. He'd asked most of them now. Could he take her out to dinner again? Would she consent to make love with him? Would she come to see a film with him? Would she allow him to go down on her? Did she like Sunday morning lie-ins with coffee, croissants, and swearing at a stack of newspapers? Could he touch her there? Would she come to this Party event as his plus one? Would she suck him off if he asked nicely? If he begged obscenely? Would she come away with him to Spain for a long weekend together?

Yes, yes, she'd always said yes to him, and he'd always done his best to make sure she never regretted it. And now he was about to make her come in his arms in the open air on a beach. He eased off before she got there, kissed her again, and rubbed his nose against hers.

"Yeah, darling, may I take you? I'd love to take you now. Take you right here, on the fucking beach. Yeah?"

"Mmm, okay. Get your trousers off."

She fumbled with his zip then abandoned him to it and got her skirt up. Malcolm didn't take his trousers off, just shoved them down far enough to be out of the way. There was no one about to mind the sight of his pasty white arse, at least. The beach was private, and no one was in sight and Malcolm was as turned on as he ever got. He levered himself up over her and let her guide him home. "Yeah," he said, "yeah, fuck, that's good." A tiny part of his mind might have reminded him that it felt too good, skin on skin, that he had gone into her bare, but he ignored it. He was dizzy with wine, lust, love, and a thousand other emotions. Didn't have words for any of them, but he didn't need to. He had her name, which he whispered in her ear. A magic name.

"Love the way you say it," she said. "The way you almost roll the R but then don't."

"You mocking me? Mocking the Weegie?"

"Wouldn't dream of it. Not when you have me in this position."

"You like this position."

"Oh, I do."

Malcolm rewarded her by biting at her throat, gently, just enough to get her to moan instead of talking. He did love it when she talked. Loved everything she did. Loved the way she was squeezing him then, the way her heels were digging into the backs of his knees, the way she was so slick around him. He told her so, maybe not in the most graceful of phrases, but sincere ones. The filthier he got, the more she moaned, so he let himself wax obscene on the magic of cock in cunt, of Malcolm inside Clara, of what she made him feel and how long he would feel that way and how many kingdoms he would topple for her sake, for the sake of coming inside her, but only after she'd come first for him, would she? would she please? And there she went, shaking for him, throwing her head back for him and baring her neck for another bite. He let her ride it out and then let himself be selfish, let himself drive hard and fast, until he was the one shaking and gasping and digging his fingers into the sand.

Cooling down, still inside her, unmoving, kissing her, licking at the place on her neck he'd bitten. Softer words now, pet names, kisses on the end of her nose, her hand stroking his back. At last he slipped out of her and rolled away. A moment of mourning, because he always wanted that feeling to last forever. Tucking himself back inside his trousers, zipping up. Head back, looking up at the starry sky, an ever-deepening blue. He was in love. Why was she with him? Fucked if he knew.

Malcolm sat up and found the bottle, shook it. Another mouthful of wine for each of them, and then it was dry. Malcolm kissed Clara's wet lips and ran his fingers over her bare thigh, around and between, where her skin was wet. He brought his fingers to his lips and tasted. Salt, cunt, come. Fucking amazing. He was going to be turned on again if he wasn't careful. She was watching him lick his fingers, a glint in her eye, so he slowed down and licked his middle finger luxuriously, obscenely, finishing with a flicker of his tongue that he was sure she understood.

She grinned at him and he grinned back.

"Let's go back to the cottage, Clara, darling. Do this like civilized people."

"I was enjoying being a pair of teenagers, there."

Clara poked at his soft midsection. She was laughing at him, and he felt himself blushing. He got his revenge by lunging across her to snag her knickers before she remembered to look for them. He held them up between them, and when she grabbed for them snatched them away. He stuffed them into his trouser pocket. She stuck her tongue out at him.

"Sand in them," he said. "You don't want to put 'em on.'"

"True. I already have sand in places I don't want to discuss."

"Cottage has a hot tub," he said. He picked up the empty bottle. Clara shook sand out of the blanket and folded it.

"And another bottle of wine in a bucket of ice."

"Now that was pure brilliant, whoever planned ahead like that."

Clara took his hand and tugged him after her, and they retraced their steps up the beach. It was fully dark now, and the stars were out. The sand was cooling under his bare feet. The air was warm. He was tipsy, and it was marvelous.

"Stop fishing for compliments," she said.

"Don't need your fuckin' compliments. Got better ways to wring them out of you anyway."

Clara paused and cocked an eyebrow at him. "Oh?"

"I'll have you begging me to let you compliment me."

"What does that even mean?"

He ignored that. "Fuckin' have you begging. On your hands and knees, me behind you, I'm thinking. Best position for fingering and fucking."

"Sounds complicated."

"Dead simple. You'll see what I mean."

"You'll have to catch me first. And you run like a penguin."

And Clara let go of his hand and ran up the walkway to the cottage, laughing ridiculously. Taunting him. Malcolm stared after her, then grinned and chased her through the door.

## Seven: Planning

"I've got a chart," Clara was saying. "I've been tracking my cycles for a year now, and they're pretty regular, and so I think I know when ovulation happens. Though I can be completely sure if I correlate with temperature changes." She waved a day planner at him with one hand and an electronic thermometer at him with the other.

Malcolm had a noisy slurp of his morning coffee. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. And if we're going to have the next one exactly three years after Dougan, we should start more or less now. Well, on Monday, to be precise."

"And you are fucking precise."

"Well, I have the data. Today is probably pointless, if we're going to be efficient about it."

Malcolm rubbed his hand through his hair, which was far longer than it had been in years, and very satisfying to rub. Fuck him, why was he nervous? He hadn't meant to get her stuffed the first time. Pure accident. He loved Dougan with all his being and it was a precious accident, but now that she was talking about it so calmly, as something one planned and charted out and coldly accomplished, it felt dismaying.

He turned back to Clara, who was looking at him with narrowed eyes. "Malc, is it okay? If you don't want another kid, it's okay, but you need to tell me."

"I do! Fuck me, I do. Dougan needs a fuckin' younger sister. They're the best. Are you sure? Dougan will be barely out of the fucking pull-ups then."

"Three years is the ideal gap. Malc. What's wrong?"

"It's just, well, I don't want to be efficient about my fucking, you know? I want it to just happen."

"Oh." She smiled at him, and her dimples showed, and Malcolm felt his heart turning into a puddle of fucking embarrassing goo all over again. He was a pussy-whipped cunt, that's what he was. All she had to do was bat those eyelashes over those huge brown eyes and he was on his knees to her. Figuratively. Literally he had his arm around her and a firm hand on her pert arse pulling her up to meet his lips. Clara. His wife. His fucking wife, Clara, morning coffee on her breath, kissing him as hard as he was kissing her, letting him put his tongue in her mouth. Oh fuck, how he loved her.

He disengaged his mouth from hers with some fucking reluctance. He bent over her and let his nose bump against hers.  He said, "What about I just fuck you every day? Get home, go to bed, fuck, wake up in the morning, fuck again?"

"That might work."

"Fucking will have to work."

Malcolm picked her up and carried her kicking and giggling into the bedroom. He tossed her onto the bed, flung himself on top of her, and pinned her arms above her head. She sucked in a breath. Oh, how she loved being controlled, his sweet Clara, and how she would never ever admit it.

He thrust his tongue into her mouth, kissed her, pulled back. He said, "Gonna fuck you right now, thermometer be fucking damned. And if it takes more than three months, we're going to fucking Barcelona, getting well hammered, and fucking on the beach until you're up the duff again, so help me, Clara--"

She was under him on the bed, warm and curvy, heels tucked in the backs of his knees automatically, because that's the way they did it when he was on top, which he wasn't always, but she'd just finishing telling him it was the best position for conception, and okay, fuck him, he was going to be on top for the next little while. On top and biting at the corner of her jaw, just under her ear, while she wriggled out of her knickers. Okay. Yeah. He was hard without worries, no need for anything to help, thank fuck, just the smell of his wife, whatever the fuck it was she used on her hair overlaid on the scent of cunt, of wet horny woman, which was always a fucking turn-on. Malcolm growled into her neck, got his hand down, pulled himself out of his pajama bottoms. Nudged his cock at the right place, pushed in. Yeah, listen to her groan, feel how wet she was, ready for him already, slick for him already, cunt welcoming him in already.

Knocking her up was all about him, not about her. She'd explained it patiently; he knew it perfectly well. He had to come. She didn't. He'd be damned if he let his wife, his Clara, the love of his life, go without coming. He was going to bring her off and he was going to feel her thrusting her hips up under him, and he was going to feel her shuddering, and that was what was going to bring him off, because he was a fucking gentleman, a fucking decent man, fucking his wife, oh God, there she went under him, and he was there, he was coming, so fast, so hard, fuck fuck fuck, he loved her so much.

Malcolm collapsed onto his wife and breathed. "Clara," he said.

"I love you, too," she said to him. "You sentimental string bean."

"Fuck you too, darling."
