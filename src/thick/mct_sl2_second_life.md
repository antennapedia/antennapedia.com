Malcolm stumbled into the central chamber on Clara's heels. The alien that was upsetting the Doctor was there, all right. And it was about as disturbing a sight as he'd ever seen, a huge green blobby mass with tentacles and some odd organ that pulsed. It wasn't evil, the Doctor said, just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And it was doing *something* that was upsetting the Doctor about as much as anything ever did. The man staggered in after them with his hands clutched over his temples.

Malcolm's own head felt fucking strange, but he had no time to fuck around worrying about it. He had to get this thing off-planet and back to its proper home. Now.

Clara pointed to the controls of the teleporter. Malcolm nodded and ran for them. Clara then did the fast-talking thing to persuade the nearby humans to clear the area; she was good at persuading other people she was in charge. He was good at scaring them. He was utter shite at working out how to use a teleporter marked in a language that looked like Thai but probably wasn't. Fuck fuck fuck-- a button lit up blue at last and he slammed his fist on it. The alien vanished. Malcolm slumped over the controls and swore quietly to  himself.

The Doctor stood and then he went to the corner of the room and heaved up his guts. Malcolm got over there fast, because Clara was still busy fast-talking at the human whose power bid they'd just thwarted. He held the old Coot up while he heaved and got a hankie ready for his mouth.

"I need to get out of here. TARDIS. I need--"

"Need what?"

"I don't have-- I don't have control. It's too much." He squeezed his eyes shut and that was pain if Malcolm had ever seen it. He felt a moment of panic, then he shook himself. He had to take charge. Get the cunt out of there, back to the TARDIS, right. Pick him up, sling the man over his shoulder gracelessly in a fireman's carry, get out, back down the corridor, shouting back to Clara as he went.

TARDIS door slammed open for him as he approached, thank fuck. Into the TARDIS console room. He felt the fucker's weight now. Couldn't dump him here, though. He staggered around to the inner door.

"Darling girl, safe place for the Doctor, yeah?" The old girl responded to him as she always did. She liked him, fuck knew why, always did nice things for him. Malcolm kissed the doorway as he passed through it in thanks. First door in the corridor would be what he needed. Through and into the study. The study? He'd expected the coot's personal bedroom or med bay, not this. Okay, whatever. Fuck it, this is what the old girl thought was best.

Malcolm stepped in, swayed, let Doctor slide to the study floor.

"I'm fine," the Doctor said, from the floor, "no need to worry."

"Fuck off," Malcolm said, kindly.

He looked around. The study. This was Malcolm's favorite place, really. Had a door that opened onto the library and a collection of leather armchairs. A humidor with Cuban cigars, a spirit case with some of the best whiskey he'd ever tasted, and a pair of slippers always set out before a fireplace. Heaven in a little blue police box.

He hauled the Coot off the floor and deposited him into the nearest armchair. The Doctor leaned elbows on knees and ran his hands through his hair until it stood on end. Malcolm knelt before him, touched a hand to a knee. The Doctor's face was white.

While Malcolm knelt, waiting, the TARDIS twitched and shifted. Traveling now; even Malcolm had learned how to feel that change.

"She's got us out," Malcolm said. No answer, but the Coot's face was a bit less pasty than it had been. He looked like a man who'd had a bad shock and was recovering. Well, Malcolm knew a cure for that. He got up and open the spirit case; poured the man a finger of whiskey.

"Drink it," he said, and the Doctor complied. He made a face. Malcolm poured him another. The Doctor sipped this one more slowly.

"Okay now?"

"Better, thanks."

"What the fuck happened? That Riffle thing did something. The alien."

The Doctor sighed. He drank a little more, ran a hand through his hair again. "The Rfflalodisix boosted my telepathic abilities while I was near it. I completely lost control. I was reading everyone around me. Overwhelming. So many people."

Malcolm fixed on one thing. "You're a telepath?"

"A poor one. Mostly. I can do some parlor tricks when I'm in very close contact with someone. Nothing much more. But this-- it ripped my mind open. Turned it up to eleven."

Malcolm was long past arguing about the existence of things like this. He traveled in time every single fucking day of his life in a box that was bigger on the inside; nothing he'd believed about the world in his first life was true any more. The Doctor said he could read minds, the Doctor could read minds. That included Malcolm's mind.

Oh sodding fucking cunting hell.

"You still doing it?"

"Fading, but, ah, yes."

"Fuck."

"Yes. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I wouldn't-- I don't. Normally. Ever."

Malcolm rubbed his face. The Doctor, no matter what he might say about him, was in fact a decent bloke. Alien. Whatever. He had a code of ethics and a political sensibility Malcolm rather admired. And now he knew that Malcolm admired it because he'd just cunting *thought* it and there it went again.

"Didn't need to. Knew it already."

"Fuck me."

A wan smile. "The time we overthrew the dictatorship on Hibikisharu. Was obvious. Why I put up with you. Beyond the fact that Clara likes you for reasons I can't grasp."

"That's the only reason I put up with you too, you knitted ski mask of a twat." There was no heat in it, though, and Malcolm knew the Doctor knew that. He shook his head. He had no idea how to navigate this mess.

The Doctor said, "Leave me here for a bit while I get control of it. Tell Clara I'm okay."

"Yeah, no fucking problem." Malcolm headed for the door.

"Before you go. There's something you should know."

Malcolm stopped and turned. The Doctor looked uneasy now, like he was a little afraid of something. "What?"

"She wants it."

"Wants what?

"Us. Again. Like before. Only more." The Doctor glowered and shrugged. "Top of her mind even in a crisis. Humans!"

Oh. Malcolm's heart leapt oddly. He'd fucked Clara since that incident, and it had been good, but he'd wondered. Would she want it again? Both of them? She hadn't said. She wanted it again. Oh. He was-- well, he had feelings about it, apparently.

"You want it too," the Doctor said. He was staring at his hands now.

"Said so when we did it. Clara fucking loved it. I'll do her with you again, any time."

"That's not what you want." The Doctor's face twisted into a smile. Mind reading. Oh, *fuck*.

Malcolm hid his face in his hand, not that it did any fucking good. "Fuck. Fucking hell."

"Sorry."

He sounded sorry, too, and Malcolm couldn't bring himself to hate him. Couldn't bring himself to stand around being mind-read any more either. He took himself out of the study as quietly as he could, trying not to think, and went to break the news to Clara. Several kinds of news.

They didn't do anything about it right away. The Doctor was too raw, too opened up. The man was a bundle of nerves at the best of times, never mind when he'd just had the seething, boiling emotions of about twenty humans poured down his throat. They let it cool down to a simmer in his mind, until he was about a three out of eleven, where he'd been only a one before. It was a permanent change, apparently, and the Doctor was uneasy about it. Or so Clara said. He wasn't talking to Malcolm about it. He was, in fact, avoiding Malcolm.

Clara took him off privately and had a long talk with him, somewhere on a lovely bit of planet, and Malcolm tried not to feel left out or jealous or anything like that. He treasured the time Clara devoted to him alone, after all, those days when the Doctor had his own unfathomable agenda to pursue and left them to fend for themselves. Those were good times. He could spare the Doctor a few hours of the same treatment. It was no bother. He could occupy himself on the TARDIS reading in that spectacularly comfortable study, all curled up and comfortable in stocking feet in front of a roaring fire. It was a good life, this second life of his, on the TARDIS saving people and things that were people even though they didn't look human. The two people who were with him had more brains than he did, which is not something he'd thought even once during his career in politics. It was more pleasant than he'd ever imagined.

So let Clara spend time with her other boyfriend, the one who looked like his Da, and try not to fret or worry about what it meant about Clara's psyche. She had a type. He could fucking ignore the voices in his head warning him off, telling him that Clara liked the old man better than she liked him. Who wouldn't like a super-intelligent alien with a time machine better than a washed-up political hack?

They came back eventually, and Clara found him in the study, and curled up with him on his lap with her head on his shoulder. Malcolm fussed with her hair and felt a little better. She was a fucking treasure. She was his salvation. His second life was all thanks to her decision that he was worth more than being discarded on a political trash heap.

"The old cunt okay?" he said.

"Yeah, he's adjusting. Less freaked out than he was about all the pudding-brained hormonal stews. You know how he gets."

"Always afraid he means us when he says that."

"Apparently we're the only two exceptions in the entire universe."

Malcolm snorted gently. "So is he still mind-reading?"

"Yeah. It actually good, I think. Means he believes it when I say I'm happy. When I say we like him. Means he believes it when I tell him I want to take both of you to bed again."

Malcolm said nothing, but he squeezed Clara's arse. It was what she expected him to do, and fuck, it felt good in his hand. He'd had a good time when that gas bomb had gone off. He'd have a good time again, in his right mind, sober.

"Anyway, he says he's ready. Any time the two of us are in the mood."

Malcolm's nerves tweaked him. Stomach felt funny. He told himself it could be exactly like last time. He didn't have to do anything he hadn't done before. Fuck Clara at the same time the old Coot was fucking her; give her a good time. That would be fun. He said, "Yeah, okay. Any time you want."

"Tonight, maybe? Like, in a couple of hours. Let's go somewhere nice, have some dinner, drink some wine, then come back to the TARDIS. I know a planet."

No gas bomb to help things along this time, so yeah, a bottle of wine. Malcolm had allowed himself to drink a little bit these days, cautiously, with Clara there to stop him if he let himself have a problem again. But he didn't have the urge to obliterate himself any more, in this his second life, his happier life out somewhere in the stars. He could have a glass of wine with his two mates, his two friends, and laugh about that time the Doctor had narrowly avoided marrying a sentient vine, and the time he'd failed to avoid marrying Queen Elizabeth the First, and think about how he and the Coot and his fucking amazing girlfriend were going to go to bed together later.

He liked the Coot. Did he like him in a deeper way? The Coot thought so. Malcolm had never thought of himself as being into men. The Coot didn't seem the sort to get into men either. He was telling tales about women, not men. Malcolm didn't fash himself about it, though, because didn't seem like the Coot truly cared.  A bottle of wine shared among the three of them, a delicious dinner, the air sweet with the scent of flowers. He ate, he drank his wine, and declined a second glass. What planet was this? Malcolm had forgotten already. He was too wound up what was to come. Sex. A night in bed with his friends. The two people he lived with.

Back into the TARDIS with a giggling Clara holding his hand and the Doctor's both. Inside, door shut, locked, alone, safe. Down the corridor and there was that room again, the room Malcolm had dubbed the orgy room. What the fuck else could it be? Huge bed, red satin sheets, all the sex toys he could imagine and a lot that frankly baffled him in drawers by the bed. An orgy room. Sly old devil, this Doctor. Or maybe not this one, but previous ones. Past regenerations, Clara had said, his earlier faces had been different personalities. This one was standoffish and touchy and hard to get close to; earlier faces had been more open.

The bedroom. Kissing Clara, taking turns. Undressing her. Letting her undress them. Laughing about how many layers the Coot was wearing. Looking at him naked, at her naked. Concentrate on Clara, Malcolm told himself. Concentrate on giving her a good time. On how fucking amazing she looked out of her clothes, toned body, muscular legs, breasts that were a good handful. Waxed cunt, a pleasure to lick. Not that it was his pleasure just then, because the Doctor wanted his turn between her thighs, working her up. That gave Malcolm his own signal pleasure of putting his tongue in her mouth and his fingers on her nipples. She loved that. Pinch a nipple and Clara was guaranteed to moan and arch her back. Pinch both at once and she'd make the loveliest sounds. She made them now, all helpless, writhing beneath him, while the Doctor stuck his fingers in her and ate her out. Face wet with her, eyes closed, what a sight. Malcolm had never seen a man go down on a woman before, never realized it could be so hot.

He thought about straddling Clara's face and thrusting into her mouth. She liked that sometimes, liked being pinned and helpless, just a tiny bit, every now and then. Clara's big secret. But somehow it didn't feel right tonight. Tonight was about worshipping her, about making her moan and shiver. No pleasure for him or for the Doctor just yet. Ladies first. Clara first. All the pleasure to Clara that she deserved, and she deserved all the pleasure two men could give her and more.

Condom on the Doctor, this time, and bare for Malcolm. Switched around, the Doctor behind, Malcolm in front. He wasn't going to complain. He got to kiss Clara this time, and he loved that. Hands on her hips, tongue in her mouth. His cock in her cunt, and oh god, the feeling of the Doctor's cock in her arse, moving inside her. Listening to her moan, because this was what she liked better than anything else.

What could he say about her that he hadn't already said to her? She was beyond words. So clever, so kind, so angry, so fierce, so intense, so brave, so loving. So much of everything in one woman. He didn't deserve her. Didn't deserve her compassion, her affection. God, he loved her. Don't tell her.

His fingers on the Doctor's fingers, over Clara's clit. He held the bastard's gaze and they nodded to each other. Clara was close, and they were going to bring her to the edge and hold her there and then give her the best orgasm she'd ever had, and was the old fuck in his head talking to him? Malcolm laughed in sheer delight and how utterly fucking bizarre his life had become. *Yes, you bastard,* he thought, *I'm with you. She gets everything she wants. Clara, yes, Clara.*

The Coot didn't believe he deserved her either. United in that, as in so many other things to do with Clara. United in the desire to make her come, in the joy of hearing her breath come short, in the joy of hearing her cry out, of feeling her shudder around them. In tenderness at laying her back down on the bed between them, wiping her sweaty hair from her face.

Yeah. He had a lot in common with the man from Gallifrey, however implausibly. They both loved this woman. They'd both do anything. Holding her now, warm between them, kissing her by turns. Clara Oswald, so pretty, so blindingly quick. The woman he'd followed to the stars.

He still hadn't come. It was okay. Sometimes it took a while for him, had even when he'd been a randy teen. Stamina, he'd called it, the ability to please a woman over and over before he popped off. He boasted about it, but there were things in his head sometimes, distractions. A voice telling him he didn't deserve it. Voice was silent these days, mostly, but the habit remained. Took him a while to come.

Malcolm lay back on the giant bed and watched Clara canoodle with the Doctor. The fucker hadn't come either, judging by that erection. Was Clara going to bring him off? Suck him off? That would be something to watch. Maybe Malcolm could wank over here on his side of the bed while they did that. Or just watch. He didn't need to come at all, truth be told. He liked going frustrated, sometimes. Or wanking on his own.

No chance. Here was Clara, hand on his cock, fingers in his hair, tugging him back into the fray. Demanding something from him.

"I want to watch you. Both of you. If it's okay. If you want to."

Malcolm flushed because yeah, he could deny that he wanted to, but the Doctor knew the truth and he'd be lying to Clara about something that mattered and lying was not a thing he did in his second life, his post-rescue life. He didn't lie to her. He wouldn't. He loved her too much. He'd do whatever she wanted.

If you'd asked him what he wanted, if you'd made him confess his longing for this, he'd had said he'd want to fuck Clara at the same time as the Doctor, do what they'd done last time, and leave it at that. He would never have said he wanted this. The old man-- the ageless alien, who happened to have gray hair now-- the unfathomable being who let them live with him on his unfathomable space ship-- this man was kissing him almost tenderly. Hands in his hair, stroking it, touching his face, kissing his forehead, the end of his nose, his lips. Telling him-- in words, in thoughts, Malcolm had no idea-- telling him he was wanted, was welcome, was family. The three of them, together, bound by affection, by a deep loyalty. No idea how it came to be. No idea how he could ever deserve such a thing.

"I always wondered the same thing," the Doctor said.

"What happened to change your mind?"

"I met Clara Oswald."

"Yeah. Yeah. Too fucking right."

"You're a pair of idiots, you know that?" Clara said.

"Your idiots," said the Doctor, and Malcolm couldn't help but agree. Her idiots.

"Malc," she said. "Hey."

Malcolm untangled himself from the Doctor and looked up at Clara, his lovely Clara. At those thick eyebrows over those beautiful eyes, that mischievous look on her face. She held up a condom.

"For you," she said. Malcolm rolled onto his back, lay there passively while she opened it, rolled it onto him. Oh, yeah, Clara's hands on him, so sweet. She wanted him to fuck the Doctor. The Doctor wanted to be fucked. Not just by anybody. By him. God, somebody wanted him. They both wanted him. How? How had this ever happened to him?

Malcolm knelt up, wiped sweat off his face with his arm. Sweat, yeah. Not tears, no fucking way. He was not a sentimental fool.

The Doctor was on his back, knees drawn up. Yeah, okay, that was the way she wanted it, that was what she wanted to see, what she wanted her men doing. He was going to do this. He could do this. He could kneel between the Doctor's thighs, take himself in hand, guide himself into an arsehole, a man's arsehole, below a heavy ballsack and a hard prick. He could admit it felt good. He could moan as he pushed in, feel a thrill at the sound of the other cunt moaning too. Oh, it was good. Tight. Like Clara's arse had been. Different to a cunt. Differently good. Friction, yeah, the thrill of watching his cock slide in and out of somebody, the pleasure of hearing his partner's pleasure. Yeah. He could fuck another man in the arse. He could admit he liked it.

He could touch another man's cock, yes, he could, he could wrap his hand around Time Lord prick and stroke, eyes locked with the old bastard's, the touch of his mind still there. And then Clara's hand was on his, helping, and she was kissing the Doctor. A pretty sight, like looking into a mirror of time and watching himself kiss Clara two decades from now, his gray-haired self, or something like, and then the Doctor was going tense, and his head was back and all the cords on his throat tight, and there it was, the Doctor was coming, coming in Malcolm's hand, all over his fingers, and fucked if he gave a damn at all, because it was lovely to watch and satisfying to feel and fuck, he felt warm all over.

More fucking touch-telepathy. That was the Doctor in his head. The old Coot. Not that Malcolm could call him that any more. Not when they were shagging. This counted as shagging. He was up the man's arse, balls-deep in him, and it was not a thing he could deny any longer. It felt good. He had another man's come all over his fingers and his girlfriend was biting his neck and fuck, his orgasm was coming at last, building inside him, that moment when he knew it was fucking there, no holding off, and yeah, oh yeah, driving his hips forward, coming, coming inside the Doctor, inside another man, fuck, he was doing it, he'd done it, he'd come.

Time for cuddles, now, the quiet moments afterward, with Clara held between them. Except that the two of them were conspiring against him. He was sandwiched between the two of them, and his head was on the Coot's shoulder. Clara was snugged up behind him, a hand on his hollow chest. Who knew she liked knobby-kneed scrawny Scots gits? Because she did. She had two of them. And he had one of his own.

Second life? Not sure he'd ever lived before this life, not in any way that mattered.
