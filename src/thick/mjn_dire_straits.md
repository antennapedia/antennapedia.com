Julius paced back and forth across Malcolm's office. "You frightened her, is-- is what I am saying Nicola said to me."

"Why the fuck should I care that I frightened her? I meant to frighten her. I'm supposed to frighten her. Tom *sent* me there to fucking frighten her."

"Yes, and she knows that, and she says it was a bit beyond the usual acceptable levels of frightening. You threaten absurd things; she swears back then falls into line. But this time--"

"This time *what*?"

Malcolm looked a little unhinged at that moment, the whites showing all around his eyes. He shoved forward into Julius, leading with his chin. Julius laid a hand on his chest and pushed to hold him in place. "Malcolm. When were you last at home?"

Malcolm turned away and flung his hands up. "Fucked if I know. Tuesday? I think. Sam will know. Why?"

"When's the last time you ate?"

"How the fuck am I supposed to remember that?"

"Right. We're leaving. Don't bother to take anything. You'll be rather too busy."

"But--"

"Do as I say, Malcolm." Julius put the least, tiniest bit of command into that voice, so Malcolm would take his meaning.

"Fuck," Malcolm said, but Julius could see the relief.

He guided Malcolm into the outer office with a hand on his shoulder. "Sam, I'm taking him home. You should be long since home yourself."

Sam smiled at him and nodded; they had an understanding about what to do when Malcolm allowed himself to reach this sort of state, and Julius was grateful she was discreet. Not that there was anything to hide, but Malcolm's reputation as a terror would suffer, rather, if anyone were to know Julius doted on him quite as much as he did. He texted his own PA word to bring the car around from where he'd been idling waiting for just such an instruction.

Malcolm looked grim in the fluorescent light of the elevator, unshaven, eyes reddened. A muscle in the corner of his jaw was pulsing. His suit was rumpled. He'd begun wearing rather better-fitted jackets in recent months, thanks to Julius's hints and some surprisingly enjoyable expeditions to shops, but he still refused to consider Julius's man on Savile Row. No bespoke anything for Malcolm. Not yet, anyway.

"How angry were you, by the by?" Julius said, at pains to keep his tone casual.

Malcolm chewed at the side of his thumb. "I broke something. Not fucking sure what. Some shite toy she had on her desk."

Julius rubbed his chin but said nothing. Nicola had reported as much; the situation was dire. The elevator doors slid open and he headed out through the security checkpoint to the pavement, confident that Malcolm was following. Once they were out of the government buildings and seated in the back of Julius's car they were two men having a quiet but completely above-board affair, well-known to Tom and to a few other people who mattered. Once they passed the threshold of Julius's London house, they were more than that: two men who had an arrangement that went beyond the conventional. Once the door closed behind them and Julius turned the lock, Malcolm belonged to him.

Julius hung up his overcoat and walked into his ground-floor office without waiting to see if Malcolm followed. If he didn't follow, it would be a sign that drastic measures were needed. That had happened before; it usually meant that Julius had let too much time pass since his last serious session alone with Malcolm. It was entirely possible he was in such a state now. Poor devil, Malcolm. Such a fragile man, really, under the bluster.

He followed this time, however. He took off his jacket and draped it messily over the back of one of Julius's leather  armchairs. Cheeky. Julius ignored it, however.

"I would like you over my desk, please, Malcolm. Trousers down."

Malcolm put his hands on his hips and bared his teeth. "Not going to give me a drink first? Chat me up?"

"If you make me use force I shall be most vexed," Julius said. Malcolm's eyes widened and for a frightening second Julius thought he would have to do it. Then Malcolm's shoulders slumped and he looked down at his feet. He drew in a long deep breath, and then another. Julius gave him the time he needed. There was no sense rushing it. Malcolm would not find peace if he were fighting it all the way.

Eventually, Malcolm spoke. "Yes, sir," he said, simply.

There it was, the first indication of the evening that he was going to yield even though he found it difficult. Julius found himself relaxing. Malcolm went over to the desk. He undid his belt and flies and pushed his trousers down to his ankles. Then he bent himself over Julius's desk and grasped the far edge, most obediently. A satisfying sight, Malcolm Tucker bent over his desk with his arse out, ready for whatever Julius wished to do with it.

Julius ranged himself behind Malcolm and invested a moment in looming, hovering, to ratchet up the tension. Then he nudged at Malcolm's feet, to push them out further, as far as they would go with his clothing still tangled around his ankles. Such a satisfying sight he made, with his arse up, his hardening manhood dangling down between spread thighs. One thing to do, before they began, to get Malcolm further into the headspace Julius wanted him to be in. He took Malcolm's buttocks, forced them apart, and looked. Malcolm went rigid under him, then slowly relaxed.

"Are you clean?"

"What? Fuck, no. No time."

"Could you say that again? I couldn't make out your answer."

Malcolm swore again, under his breath this time. "No, sir. I'm not."

Julius clucked. "We'll deal with that later." A taste of humiliation, barely enough to remind Malcolm of his position, of his role in this relationship. And if Julius found it most satisfying to see Malcolm's ears turn red, that was entirely a side benefit. "Now, what is it that you need right now, Malcolm?"

"You fucking know what I need."

"This may be true, but we have an agreement about it. You are going to use your words to ask for it. Polite words. Respectful words."

Malcolm was silent in response to this. Julius watched him carefully, with all the concern and consideration and careful attention required of a top for his bottom. It was a burden Julius accepted most cheerfully, but at times like this it was difficult.

"Malcolm," he said at last, with warning in his voice.

"Sir."

"Tell me what you need."

"I fucking need to be punished for fucking swearing at you, *sir*. Shit. Fuck. Sorry, sir. Fucking hell, I haven't been home since Tuesday."

"I know."

"Julius. Please. Fucking can't."

Julius laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. Malcolm shuddered and made a sound Julius knew well. Yes, he'd left it too long. It would be harder than usual on both of them, therefore, to make up for his failure to notice that Malcolm was in difficulties. He said, with some emotion in his voice, "Very well, Malcolm."

He paced away to the drawer where he kept the necessities available; there were of course more in the bedroom but he'd found it prudent to keep his office stocked as well. He unlocked it, touched his fingers to his lips for a moment, thinking. The schoolmaster's cane would be right for this. Sharp, attention-getting, leaving bruises that would last for long enough to keep Malcolm calm for days, but not savage. Almost pleasurable, in Julius's recollection. Almost.

"Now, I think ten. For swearing at me, for failing to address me correctly, and for failing to ask for this politely."

Malcolm shuddered. "Fuck. Yes, sir."

"You know my requirements of you. Please do not disappoint me."

Julius opened his mouth to go on, then shut it. He had a deplorable tendency to babble at his moments, from his own nerves as much as anything. He was about to cane another man's bottom, and if he were honest the very idea of it had made his trousers feel too tight. The reality of doing it would make him even more aroused. Another man-- his partner, his boyfriend, his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow pub fighter lover-- would cry out under his blows in another moment. Such a delicious moment, savoring his own anticipation, the trembling fear in the man who'd prostrated himself willingly for this. Another moment, then he could wait no more. Julius raised the cane, judged the desirable force carefully, then made himself swing harder. It came down across Malcolm's buttocks and the sound was simply marvelous.

Malcolm jerked and squawked. "Fuck! The fuck was that?"

"Tch," said Julius.

Malcolm swiveled around and glared at him. Julius held that gaze, implacable, arms folded, cane in hand. Malcolm blinked first. He let his forehead come down on the desk and tightened his fingers on the end of the desk so hard his fingers went white. Julius counted his breaths: three, four. Then Malcolm released his grip, returned to position, and nodded.

"My apologies, sir," he said, and his voice was strained. "It won't happen again."

"I'm sure it won't," Julius said, "but we shall add on two strokes as a guarantee."

A noisy breath blown out that Julius chose to ignore; Malcolm would regret it enough for now. Then Malcolm said, with something approximating respect, "Yes, sir, thank you, sir."

Julius raised the cane and brought it down again. Such a satisfying sensation this was for him, the noise, the feeling of impact, the sound it made against Malcolm's buttocks, the sounds Malcolm made in the moments afterward, as Julius gave him time to let the pain flood through him, the endorphins flow, his brain-state change. By the twelfth stroke Malcolm was keening and pleading with him for something unnamed, possibly unnameable, but something only Julius could give him. Something he needed desperately. Something Julius wished to give him to equally desperately.

Julius set the cane down and went to him, clasped his shoulders, stroked his hair. There he was, Malcolm Tucker, with tears dripping from his nose, breath coming fast. His jaw was no longer clenched. Something had released in him in those last few strokes. That was the trick of it, for Julius, watching his partner carefully for the moment when it was enough, when the goal had been achieved.

Julius helped Malcolm stand up again, unsteadily, and held him close.

"What that what you needed, Malcolm?"

Malcolm closed his eyes, nodded. Julius dabbed at his face with a handkerchief, dried his tears carefully. Malcolm remained still for this, hands resting against Julius's chest. Julius touched fingers under his chin and tipped up his face. He kissed Malcolm, and there it was, that sweet pliancy that Malcolm only achieved after he'd been whipped, that surrender he craved but could not allow himself without Julius's permission. He opened his mouth for Julius and closed his eyes and kissed him in return so gently, so openly, so-- if Julius dared to think it-- soulfully, with his anger at last purged. Or if not that, if that was impossible in a man as knotted up as Malcolm, at least his anger was submerged for the nonce.

Julius slipped a hand down Malcolm's back, slipped under his shirttail, and cupped a buttock. Hot to the touch, and Malcolm sucked in a breath involuntarily. Lovely. Simply perfect. Julius was himself deeply aroused, and feeling a rather urgent desire for more physical contact with Malcolm, for the feeling of his body underneath, those heated buttocks against his thighs. It was not yet time to act on that need, however. The night was nowhere near over, and Julius would not consider it over until both he and his lover were satisfied, well fed, clean, and warm in bed together (Malcolm of course nude).

More work to do. Pleasurable work, to be sure. Julius cradled Malcolm in his arms and sighed.
