# Dire Straits

Julius paced back and forth across Malcolm's office. "You frightened her, is-- is what I am saying Nicola said to me."

"Why the fuck should I care that I frightened her? I meant to frighten her. I'm supposed to frighten her. Tom *sent* me there to fucking frighten her."

"Yes, and she knows that, and she says it was a bit beyond the usual acceptable levels of frightening. You threaten absurd things; she swears back then falls into line. But this time--"

"This time *what*?"

Malcolm looked a little unhinged at that moment, the whites showing all around his eyes. He shoved forward into Julius, leading with his chin. Julius laid a hand on his chest and pushed to hold him in place. "Malcolm. When were you last at home?"

Malcolm turned away and flung his hands up. "Fucked if I know. Tuesday? I think. Sam will know. Why?"

"When's the last time you ate?"

"How the fuck am I supposed to remember that?"

"Right. We're leaving. Don't bother to take anything. You'll be rather too busy."

"But--"

"Do as I say, Malcolm." Julius put the least, tiniest bit of command into that voice, so Malcolm would take his meaning.

"Fuck," Malcolm said, but Julius could see the relief.

He guided Malcolm into the outer office with a hand on his shoulder. "Sam, I'm taking him home. You should be long since home yourself."

Sam smiled at him and nodded; they had an understanding about what to do when Malcolm allowed himself to reach this sort of state, and Julius was grateful she was discreet. Not that there was anything to hide, but Malcolm's reputation as a terror would suffer, rather, if anyone were to know Julius doted on him quite as much as he did. He texted his own PA word to bring the car around from where he'd been idling waiting for just such an instruction.

Malcolm looked grim in the fluorescent light of the elevator, unshaven, eyes reddened. A muscle in the corner of his jaw was pulsing. His suit was rumpled. He'd begun wearing rather better-fitted jackets in recent months, thanks to Julius's hints and some surprisingly enjoyable expeditions to shops, but he still refused to consider Julius's man on Savile Row. No bespoke anything for Malcolm. Not yet, anyway.

"How angry were you, by the by?" Julius said, at pains to keep his tone casual.

Malcolm chewed at the side of his thumb. "I broke something. Not fucking sure what. Some shite toy she had on her desk."

Julius rubbed his chin but said nothing. Nicola had reported as much; the situation was dire. The elevator doors slid open and he headed out through the security checkpoint to the pavement, confident that Malcolm was following. Once they were out of the government buildings and seated in the back of Julius's car they were two men having a quiet but completely above-board affair, well-known to Tom and to a few other people who mattered. Once they passed the threshold of Julius's London house, they were more than that: two men who had an arrangement that went beyond the conventional. Once the door closed behind them and Julius turned the lock, Malcolm belonged to him.

Julius hung up his overcoat and walked into his ground-floor office without waiting to see if Malcolm followed. If he didn't follow, it would be a sign that drastic measures were needed. That had happened before; it usually meant that Julius had let too much time pass since his last serious session alone with Malcolm. It was entirely possible he was in such a state now. Poor devil, Malcolm. Such a fragile man, really, under the bluster.

He followed this time, however. He took off his jacket and draped it messily over the back of one of Julius's leather  armchairs. Cheeky. Julius ignored it, however.

"I would like you over my desk, please, Malcolm. Trousers down."

Malcolm put his hands on his hips and bared his teeth. "Not going to give me a drink first? Chat me up?"

"If you make me use force I shall be most vexed," Julius said. Malcolm's eyes widened and for a frightening second Julius thought he would have to do it. Then Malcolm's shoulders slumped and he looked down at his feet. He drew in a long deep breath, and then another. Julius gave him the time he needed. There was no sense rushing it. Malcolm would not find peace if he were fighting it all the way.

Eventually, Malcolm spoke. "Yes, sir," he said, simply.

There it was, the first indication of the evening that he was going to yield even though he found it difficult. Julius found himself relaxing. Malcolm went over to the desk. He undid his belt and flies and pushed his trousers down to his ankles. Then he bent himself over Julius's desk and grasped the far edge, most obediently. A satisfying sight, Malcolm Tucker bent over his desk with his arse out, ready for whatever Julius wished to do with it.

Julius ranged himself behind Malcolm and invested a moment in looming, hovering, to ratchet up the tension. Then he nudged at Malcolm's feet, to push them out further, as far as they would go with his clothing still tangled around his ankles. Such a satisfying sight he made, with his arse up, his hardening manhood dangling down between spread thighs. One thing to do, before they began, to get Malcolm further into the headspace Julius wanted him to be in. He took Malcolm's buttocks, forced them apart, and looked. Malcolm went rigid under him, then slowly relaxed.

"Are you clean?"

"What? Fuck, no. No time."

"Could you say that again? I couldn't make out your answer."

Malcolm swore again, under his breath this time. "No, sir. I'm not."

Julius clucked. "We'll deal with that later." A taste of humiliation, barely enough to remind Malcolm of his position, of his role in this relationship. And if Julius found it most satisfying to see Malcolm's ears turn red, that was entirely a side benefit. "Now, what is it that you need right now, Malcolm?"

"You fucking know what I need."

"This may be true, but we have an agreement about it. You are going to use your words to ask for it. Polite words. Respectful words."

Malcolm was silent in response to this. Julius watched him carefully, with all the concern and consideration and careful attention required of a top for his bottom. It was a burden Julius accepted most cheerfully, but at times like this it was difficult.

"Malcolm," he said at last, with warning in his voice.

"Sir."

"Tell me what you need."

"I fucking need to be punished for fucking swearing at you, *sir*. Shit. Fuck. Sorry, sir. Fucking hell, I haven't been home since Tuesday."

"I know."

"Julius. Please. Fucking can't."

Julius laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. Malcolm shuddered and made a sound Julius knew well. Yes, he'd left it too long. It would be harder than usual on both of them, therefore, to make up for his failure to notice that Malcolm was in difficulties. He said, with some emotion in his voice, "Very well, Malcolm."

He paced away to the drawer where he kept the necessities available; there were of course more in the bedroom but he'd found it prudent to keep his office stocked as well. He unlocked it, touched his fingers to his lips for a moment, thinking. The schoolmaster's cane would be right for this. Sharp, attention-getting, leaving bruises that would last for long enough to keep Malcolm calm for days, but not savage. Almost pleasurable, in Julius's recollection. Almost.

"Now, I think ten. For swearing at me, for failing to address me correctly, and for failing to ask for this politely."

Malcolm shuddered. "Fuck. Yes, sir."

"You know my requirements of you. Please do not disappoint me."

Julius opened his mouth to go on, then shut it. He had a deplorable tendency to babble at his moments, from his own nerves as much as anything. He was about to cane another man's bottom, and if he were honest the very idea of it had made his trousers feel too tight. The reality of doing it would make him even more aroused. Another man-- his partner, his boyfriend, his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow pub fighter lover-- would cry out under his blows in another moment. Such a delicious moment, savoring his own anticipation, the trembling fear in the man who'd prostrated himself willingly for this. Another moment, then he could wait no more. Julius raised the cane, judged the desirable force carefully, then made himself swing harder. It came down across Malcolm's buttocks and the sound was simply marvelous.

Malcolm jerked and squawked. "Fuck! The fuck was that?"

"Tch," said Julius.

Malcolm swiveled around and glared at him. Julius held that gaze, implacable, arms folded, cane in hand. Malcolm blinked first. He let his forehead come down on the desk and tightened his fingers on the end of the desk so hard his fingers went white. Julius counted his breaths: three, four. Then Malcolm released his grip, returned to position, and nodded.

"My apologies, sir," he said, and his voice was strained. "It won't happen again."

"I'm sure it won't," Julius said, "but we shall add on two strokes as a guarantee."

A noisy breath blown out that Julius chose to ignore; Malcolm would regret it enough for now. Then Malcolm said, with something approximating respect, "Yes, sir, thank you, sir."

Julius raised the cane and brought it down again. Such a satisfying sensation this was for him, the noise, the feeling of impact, the sound it made against Malcolm's buttocks, the sounds Malcolm made in the moments afterward, as Julius gave him time to let the pain flood through him, the endorphins flow, his brain-state change. By the twelfth stroke Malcolm was keening and pleading with him for something unnamed, possibly unnameable, but something only Julius could give him. Something he needed desperately. Something Julius wished to give him to equally desperately.

Julius set the cane down and went to him, clasped his shoulders, stroked his hair. There he was, Malcolm Tucker, with tears dripping from his nose, breath coming fast. His jaw was no longer clenched. Something had released in him in those last few strokes. That was the trick of it, for Julius, watching his partner carefully for the moment when it was enough, when the goal had been achieved.

Julius helped Malcolm stand up again, unsteadily, and held him close.

"What that what you needed, Malcolm?"

Malcolm closed his eyes, nodded. Julius dabbed at his face with a handkerchief, dried his tears carefully. Malcolm remained still for this, hands resting against Julius's chest. Julius touched fingers under his chin and tipped up his face. He kissed Malcolm, and there it was, that sweet pliancy that Malcolm only achieved after he'd been whipped, that surrender he craved but could not allow himself without Julius's permission. He opened his mouth for Julius and closed his eyes and kissed him in return so gently, so openly, so-- if Julius dared to think it-- soulfully, with his anger at last purged. Or if not that, if that was impossible in a man as knotted up as Malcolm, at least his anger was submerged for the nonce.

Julius slipped a hand down Malcolm's back, slipped under his shirttail, and cupped a buttock. Hot to the touch, and Malcolm sucked in a breath involuntarily. Lovely. Simply perfect. Julius was himself deeply aroused, and feeling a rather urgent desire for more physical contact with Malcolm, for the feeling of his body underneath, those heated buttocks against his thighs. It was not yet time to act on that need, however. The night was nowhere near over, and Julius would not consider it over until both he and his lover were satisfied, well fed, clean, and warm in bed together (Malcolm of course nude).

More work to do. Pleasurable work, to be sure. Julius cradled Malcolm in his arms and sighed.

# The Right Word

Julius tugged Malcolm close and encouraged him to lay his head on Julius's shoulder. Malcolm shivered and complied. He allowed himself the indulgence of his hand remaining on that firm buttock, his fingers tracing along the heated welts he'd left there. The schoolmaster's cane had indeed been perfect. Malcolm was as yet trembling against him, but was not so wrung out as to be finished for the evening. He would find an excuse to use it again, but in the meantime--they were, as he had just phrased it, not yet finished. He had yet more business with his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow-pub-fighter lover, whatever the right word for him was. Malcolm used the word "master" for him sometimes, but none of the words Julius had tried for Malcolm were quite right. "Slave", for example, was completely inappropriate to describe a man who would argue with him even when he was being spanked.

The precise word didn't matter to Julius, however. What mattered was continuing to care for Malcolm.

"Now, Malcolm," Julius said, "I want you to undress all the way. Leave your clothing here, folded. Then go upstairs and take a shower and clean yourself out for me. Thoroughly. Plug yourself with the black plug, the large one. Then join me in the kitchen. Should have some dinner ready for you."

"Not sure I'm hungry."

"I know you're not sure, but I'm your master. And I know what you need."

"Yeah. Okay."

"Malcolm, I require formality from you tonight. Until I release you, if you please, you will address me properly."

Malcolm pulled back from his embrace and looked up at him, a little uncertain. Such a lovely face he had, sharp and intent and wolfish, so beautiful when he'd been crying and his lashes were wet and his eyes red-rimmed. Then he looked down, a little bashful, and said, "Yes, sir. Sorry, sir."

"You are forgiven. Go, that is to say, hop to it, please."

Julius took himself off to the kitchen to put together a little something for the pair of them, leaving Malcolm alone in his office to undress. It was a pleasant show to watch, but Julius wanted to give him a little time to recover himself. The evening had, after all, many hours left in it, and Julius was not quite finished with him. If he was right--and he suspected he was--Malcolm had not yet truly surrendered. He was holding himself back even after the caning. He might have released his fury with Nicola from earlier in the day, but it had been going on all week, hadn't it? Not home since Tuesday. That was far longer than he was supposed to let it go. He'd promised Julius faithfully he wouldn't push himself so. He was, in fact, supposed to have texted Julius to tell him if he'd gone more than a day without sleep.

Julius moved a pan from hob to the side and clucked. He'd botched this, rather. He ought to have checked in with Malcolm. Instead he'd allowed himself to get involved in that series of meetings in Den Hague, meetings that somebody else could easily have attended. He could have come back an entire day earlier than he had.

His brooding was interrupted by the sound of Malcolm clearing his throat.

"Sir," he said.

Julius smiled at him, because it was, as ever, lovely to see Malcolm clean-shaven, scrubbed pink, hair still damp and sticking up. He was nude and slightly uncomfortable to be so, standing there in Julius's lovely modern kitchen under hanging copper pans. His erection had waned, and his hands were clasped in front of himself as if to hide it. Submissive, yes, but not yet fully in the frame of mind Julius needed him in.

"Hands in the small of your back, please. And turn around so I can see your plug. Ah, good. That's the one I meant. Did you clean yourself in the shower?"

Malcolm did not quite hate the douches, but he found Julius's insistence on them maddening. Certainly he hated being watched doing it, or having it done to him while he submitted. Periodically Julius had to renew that experience of humiliation, as it was one of the things Malcolm had requested from him specifically. The subjugation of his body to Julius's wishes. The subjugation of himself. Of his own will to that of his owner. The man who cared for him, in all senses.

Now, at Julius's question, his face flushed dark red and he hung his head. "Yes, sir," he said.

"How many times?"

"Three times. Sir."

"Very good. Do you think you are able to sit down to eat your dinner?"

Malcolm looked at the tall wooden stools in Julius's kitchen, at their leather-padded tops. "Think so, sir."

Julius gestured toward the nearest stood and watched. Malcolm bit his lip but he could not contain his wince or the little breath that escaped him as he adjusted his position on the stool. Julius smiled. He might as well admit the base physical pleasure he felt in response to the expression on Malcolm's face. It was one of the many things he himself found to enjoy in this relationship, even beyond the affection he felt for Malcolm and the joy he found in caring for him and tending to him. Malcolm was a wild animal, a tight-wound bundle of nerves who would always be more effective than Julius at the day-to-day exigencies of his job. He needed gentle handling, however. He needed his steady PA Sam, his surprisingly solid lieutenant MacDonald, and he needed his lover.

Keeping him on an even keel took a lot of work. Whipping him to serenity took a lot of work. Surely it was acceptable that Julius could allow himself to enjoy watching him sit on his bruised backside and wince.

Malcolm looked up at him and smiled sardonically. He knew what Julius was watching for. He looked down at the marble countertop, at the cup of consommé Julius set before him. Nothing spicy, bland food, safe food, suitable for a man who had likely been surviving on a diet of caffeine and sugar for the last three days. A bit of broth and some good French bread, steamed vegetables. Water with lime in it. Light fare, nothing to sit heavily in the stomach afterward. Julius was tempted to feed Malcolm with his own hands--he had done this before and Malcolm had loathed it with every fiber of his being--but it didn't feel right for tonight. Tonight he would restrain himself to making sure Malcolm had everything he wished to engaging him in small talk, and to attempting to coax from Malcolm some sort of reason why he'd let himself get to the state he'd been in without contacting Julius for help.

There were, however, no answers to be had from Malcolm. He was obedient to the letter of Julius's instructions, scrupulous in how he addressed his master, but not forthcoming in the least. Julius cleared the counter enough that the houseboy wouldn't find too much of a mess in the morning, and sighed. His trial wasn't over. Malcolm's trial or his own? It would be a trial for the both of them.

"The bedroom, please," Julius said.

Malcolm preceded him up the stairs so Julius could enjoy the sight of his arms folded behind his back, the livid red stripes across his thighs. He waited at the foot of Julius's grand bed quietly, head down, but his eyes followed Julius almost anxiously. Julius had given him no hints about what was to follow, and indeed he would give no hints until it was upon them. He might, after all, lose his own heart. But his agreement with Malcolm required that he steel himself for it.

Julius methodically removed his jacket, tie, and shoes. He tucked his cufflinks away in their velvet box and rolled his shirtsleeves neatly to mid-forearm. He removed his watch and set it on his dresser. He flexed the fingers of his right hand. Was he ready for this? He was.

He turned to Malcolm, who was motionless in position, but tense and no longer looking at him. Julius went up to him and took his chin in hand and tipped it up to force Malcolm to meet his eyes.

"We shall now deal with the matter of your misbehavior during the week. You did not contact me and ask for assistance, as you expressly agreed to do the last time this happened."

Malcolm's brows furrowed. "You were too busy."

"What did I just hear?" Warning signals in his voice, and Malcolm blinked rapidly.

"You seemed too busy, *sir*. I didna want tae bother you, off on your trip."

"That's not good enough, Malcolm. You know better. Now, why didn't you contact me and at least talk with me on the phone?"

"I will next time, sir. Sorry, sir. The caning made your point."

"The caning was clearly not enough. I'm going to have to spank you until I get an honest response from you."

Malcolm's eyes widened and he looked as if he were about to protest. Then he thought better of it. Julius had taught him successfully that resistance only made it worse. "Sir," he said, and set his jaw.

"Shall we begin?"

"Sir." No fear yet, only stubborn resentment. Well, he would need to learn.

Julius sat on his bed, back against the headboard, legs outstretched. He preferred this position to a straight chair or stool, though those had their advantages. Malcolm laid himself over Julius's lap at a mere gesture of command. They'd done this many times. Malcolm had resisted it at first, balked at the position, begged for the desk instead. The intimacy of it, perhaps, frightened him. Certainly he could hide nothing from Julius when he was this close to him, so close that Julius could feel his every quiver, his every breath. Julius nudged him gently so his thighs were spread wide, exposing everything: that heavy ballsack, the erection that was beginning to make itself known again, the base of the plug.

"Now," Julius said, "Clasp your hands at the back of your neck and do not move them until you have permission."

Malcolm shuddered but obeyed.

Julius opened his mouth to make another little speech at Malcolm about what he was about to do, then shut his mouth again. It was a terrible flaw, this urge he had. Instead, he ought to simply raise his hand and bring it down on Malcolm's backside, hard. He hardened his resolve and did so.

Ah, there it was, the sound, the feeling of heat exploding against his palm, the jerk Malcolm made over his knees. Left cheek, right cheek, pause. Listen to Malcolm's harsh breathing hitch and recover. Then again a pair of blows, lower down, a moment to let the pain wash over Malcolm. Again, even lower. And again, the slaps landing on Malcolm's thighs now, as hard as Julius dared.

That wrested a whimper from him. Julius paused and let his hand rest on that deliciously reddened backside. He let his fingers slide between Malcolm's cheeks, delicately, paused on the base of the plug to play with it, then down far enough to tease his bollocks. Malcolm was trembling against him and yes, there were tears on his face again.

"How are you feeling, Malcolm?" Julius asked. It was, perhaps, the question Malcolm feared most.

"My arse hurts, sir." His voice was rough, but there was resistance in it yet.

"Why didn't you contact me this week?"

"Sir," Malcolm said. "No fucking idea."

This was what he'd anticipated when he'd acknowledged to himself that it would be hard on both of them. Malcolm had been whipped hard enough that he'd been brought to tears earlier, and now he was weeping again. His buttocks and thighs were hot to the touch, and so was Julius's right palm. But it was not enough to make up for Julius's neglect. It had been own damn fault Malcolm had thought he was too busy, and now he had to do this until the both of them were completely wrung out.

"We will continue until you're able to tell me."

And he continued, harder now and faster than before, giving Malcolm no respite, no time to recover and breathe. If brutality was required, Julius would rise to the occasion and be brutal. His hand burned, but he raised it and spanked, over and over. Malcolm writhed under him, keened, swore, but his hands stayed clasped, he remained in position. And then something shifted, something broke, and Malcolm went limp. His shoulders were shaking.

"Sir," Malcolm was saying, repeating it over and over. "Julius. Sir. Please, sir, hold me. Fucking hold me. Fucking need you."

There it was, there was what Julius had wanted to see, Malcolm completely unwound, weeping helplessly, shaking in Julius's arms, burrowing his face into Julius's neck, clinging tight. Julius held him and rocked him, listened to his half-coherent tale of the week, of how stupid they all were, how not a single one of them was worthy of running the nation, of how much Malcolm worried and how helpless he was, and how many mistakes he'd made and how nothing he did was any good. The shame of it, of failing again and letting a story go out unchecked in the press about something utterly pointless. Julius listened, soothed him, wiped the tears from his face and the snot from his nose and kissed him. Kissed his hair, his eyes, his temples, his lips, kissed him until Malcolm was free of his burdens and quiet again in Julius's arms.

This was, if he confessed it, the part Julius liked best.

He laid Malcolm face down on the bed and tended to him. Salve for his legs and backside, a clean handkerchief for his tears, kisses for his hair. Malcolm blew his nose and lay patiently while Julius soothed all the hurts he'd just inflicted. No salve for his own hand, though. He let that burn him as a reminder that he couldn't let Malcolm go that long ungrounded ever again. Even a quiet dinner with him would have kept him calm, but no, Julius had allowed himself to be busy, allowed himself to stay that extra day to meet with the EU official who wanted a favor. Damned fool.

Julius left Malcolm on the bed and got up to undress himself. Shirt, socks, trousers, freeing his erection from confinement at last. He returned and touched Malcolm's shoulder. "What would you like next, Malcolm?"

"Julius," Malcolm said. "Are we still formal?"

"Yes."

"Sir, can I--sir, I'd like to suck you off."

Malcolm didn't necessarily need to come on these nights, and indeed sometimes had difficulty doing so. Too worn, too tired, too hungry. Julius did not find joy in demanding that Malcolm do something he genuinely found trying without any pleasure. Obedience, yes, Malcolm had admitted--reluctantly, after much patient work from Julius in providing a safe environment--that he found pleasure in obeying Julius, no matter how much a struggle it was. So Julius strove to meet this need with structure, rules, and punishments. But orgasms? Those were reserved for nights when it was easy for Malcolm, when he wasn't a strung-out mess.

He did feel strongly about Julius's orgasms, however. He almost insisted on them. It was as if he judged himself, found himself wanting, if the man he had submitted to did not find pleasure with him. Julius found this need easy enough to accede to. Especially after he'd bruised his bare hand against Malcolm's backside. Oh, especially then, as now.

"Not tonight," Julius said. "Tonight I want to take you."

And that was a smile on Malcolm's face, there for an instant before Malcolm was craning up for another long slow kiss. Julius bade him remove the plug, and he did so while Julius watched. No embarrassment any more, no sense of reserve left in him. He was soft, pliant. He'd surrendered.

It was such pleasure to roll a condom onto himself. It was such a thrill to watch Malcolm lie back on the bed, reddened arse over the edge, and raise and spread his legs without being asked. In a moment Julius would receive his own reward for labor, his own moment of release. He considered for a moment indulging Malcolm's occasional wish for dry penetration, then decided against it this time. He himself liked it very wet, very slippery, almost messy. He used a generous handful of slick on himself, on Malcolm's arsehole. Only then did Julius let himself take him.

Penetration. Penis in hand, guiding himself into Malcolm's already-opened body, pressing into him deep, all the way in. Julius let himself move inside his Malcolm, his beloved, his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow-pub-fighter lover, and groaned with the pleasure. Malcolm was open, warm, soft, and he moaned as Julius took him. Thighs hot to the touch, hand-prints visible as well as the livid stripes from the schoolmaster's cane--oh so beautiful. Julius told Malcolm so, and Malcolm thanked him and called him sir. There was genuine openness in his voice at last, which was good, very good. He was hard but was not touching himself, of course. He'd raised a hand to his mouth and was biting at the side of his thumb. It was beautiful. He was beautiful. Malcolm was beautiful. His, his--what word could he use for Malcolm? His charge. His, his pet. That's what he was.

Julius said, "I have finally found the word. You are my pet. You're not just my property. You're my pet."

"I--oh, fuck, yes, that's what I am, fuck. Your pet."

Which was not as respectful as Julius might have liked, but the sentiment was admirable. Malcolm had endured enough and had finally been broken down and Julius could overlook it. It was far more pleasurable to move inside him, to push up against those bruised thighs and watch Malcolm wince, to watch the war between pleasure and pain on his face be won by pleasure at last. Julius looked down and watched himself move inside Malcolm. The place where they were joined, Malcolm stretched open around him, the friction, the pressure, the pleasure. He moved harder and faster, as hard as he could, driving deep into his pet's body, heedless of everything save his own needs in this moment.

"Fucking do it, Julius, sir, do it, please. Come inside me. Fucking use me. Use your pet."

"Say it again."

"I'm your pet. Your pet."

That was enough to send him over, that word on Malcolm's lips. Julius let his eyes close and his head fall back and it was there, his orgasm was upon him, and he was spending himself inside his pet, falling forward over him.

Later, when they were both showered and warm and clean, ready to go to bed together at last, Malcolm knelt up next to him. He took Julius's right hand gently and examined it, hissed out an expletive. Then he surprised Julius by bending his head and kissing his palm with as much reverence as Julius had ever seen from him.

"Thank you," he said.

Julius could not speak for a moment, he was so moved. Eventually he said, "The pleasure was mine."

"Not all yours. I feel good even if I fucking won't be able to sit tomorrow. Fuck."

Julius pulled Malcolm down so his head was pillowed on Julius's chest. He pulled the duvet up over them both and switched off the light. Comfort and warmth at last. He did so love these ends to their evenings, he in silk pajamas, Malcolm nude beside him, in his arms. His pet, in his arms.

"Malcolm. The word *pet*. Are you all right with that, that word? That description of our relationship?"

A moment of silence while Julius stroked Malcolm's hair. Then, "Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay with it. But yeah, I -- feels right, somehow."

"Ownership, responsibility. Obedience in return."

"That's it. So long as I'm not a pet lapdog or some shite like that."

"A wolf, I think. Yes, you are my pet Scottish wolf."

"There are no fucking wolves in Scotland."

"Are you quite sure?"

"None for hundreds of years."

"They're all in London now, perhaps."

"Fucking flatterer."

"My pet wolf. I shall have to give you something to wear that says this."

"So long as you don't put a radio tag in my ear."

"Nothing so drastic. Something you can wear when we're alone."

"Oh, now I see what you're after, you kinky cunt. You just want to lock a collar on me and tie me to the end of the bed."

"Don't tempt me," Julius said, and he heard Malcolm laughing at last.

# Down Time

It was, as all of Julius's presents to Malcolm were, discreet. Wolf's-head cufflinks, nothing large or gaudy or likely to trigger Malcolm's class rage or invite questions. Cufflinks for moments when Malcolm dressed for the occasion. He would decline to mention that he'd commissioned them, which knowledge would make Malcolm self-conscious about the cost. It was no matter. Malcolm was worth quite a bit more.

Malcolm looked up at him from the little velvet box in his hand and curled his lip. "Your wolf, eh?"

"My wolf."

And Malcolm was leaning in and giving Julius a kiss and that was gratifying because it was entirely open and sincere and lingering. The box was tucked into his jacket pocket and he had his arms around Julius's waist. Julius curled his fingers into Malcolm's hair, tilted his head, got his tongue into Malcolm's mouth. It was, all in all, good. What would be better would be lying on the couch with Malcolm cradled against him.

Julius gently disentangled himself from Malcolm's embrace and led him the rest of the way into his study, his sanctum sanctorum. Julius sat on the couch and kicked his shoes off. Malcolm went to the sideboard and poured him a glass of whisky, carried it back to him and bowed as he handed it over. There was a gleam in his eye, that feral glint that Julius adored so, but muted for now. Julius swiveled so his legs were stretched out along the cushions and beckoned Malcolm over. Shoes off, jacket off, and Malcolm lay himself back in Julius's arms, between his legs, cushioned against Julius's regrettably comfortable belly. Julius kissed the back of his head, took a sip of the single malt Malcolm had chosen, and made a satisfied noise.

"Sybaritic cunt," Malcolm said. "S'pose I am in no position to complain."

Julius pressed his hand against his chest and said, "How are you feeling tonight?" This was a question he demanded an answer to, no matter how much Malcolm might hate it.

There was the sigh, but then Malcolm laid his hand over Julius's and laced his fingers with his.

"Was nae a bad week," he said. "Nic'la was almost sensible. And Tom did well at questions after some truly fucking intensive prep, so he's feeling good and I'm feeling good. All's well in Whitehall."

Julius kissed the back of his neck, just below the fringe of hair. Malcolm had rather lovely hair when he let it grow, but he kept it close-cropped. A symbol of the control he had to exert over himself, perhaps. He said, a trifle indistinctly through a mouthful of whisky, "I trust your lieutenant is mollified?"

"Jamie has decided he still believes in me, yeah. Fuck knows why. I mishandled him. He's my fucking friend and I didna treat him like one. Cunt's sensitive like a little girl, yeah? Took him out for a drink and sorted it."

"The confusion with Treasury?"

Malcolm waved his free hand. "Sorted *that* two days ago. They saw it my way in the end. Still, happy it's Friday night. Happy to be here."

"Mmm," Julius said. He slipped his forefinger into the space between the button of Malcolm's shirt and touched his skin. Malcolm made a pleased sound. Cuddling, he was cuddling his pet wolf of a Friday night and it was rather wonderful.

"And how was your week, Julz?"

"Acceptable. I have hopes Tom will see reason on the banking regulations, but he's reluctant. I am feeling nervy about the markets in some respect. Over-leverage, too much risk. Iceland in particular is rather mad about borrowing. I shall likely divest."

"You know best about that shite."

"There are men I know in the City who do considerably better. I'm taking hints from some of the more cautious among them. The fellows who've been doing it for a few decades."

The topic was, however, tedious. Another sip of whisky, and the warm glow commenced its spread through his blood. Julius felt himself begin to relax at last, truly relax. Malcolm was in good case; he'd been delighted by his present. They would end their evening with love-making. Julius found himself of a mind to get started on that happy project soon. He kissed the back of Malcolm's neck again.

"Fuck," Malcolm said, and he wriggled himself closer to Julius. "Feel like I'm in fucking heaven."

Julius set the whisky tumbler aside and tugged at Malcolm's tie to loosen it. "I should hope so. I work rather hard to make you feel that way."

"Fuck knows why."

"I'm quite ridiculously fond of you," Julius said. He got the tie worked free and commencing undoing Malcolm's shirt buttons. Malcolm's backside was firmly pressed against his hips, and that was most pleasurable. Most. Arousingly so. He had a mind to defer his own gratification until later, however. He would indulge himself by fussing over Malcolm some more.

The shirt was now unbuttoned. Malcolm obligingly pulled the tails free of his trousers, so Julius could explore his bare chest at his leisure. Bare chest, narrow chest. Skin and bones, at least when Julius had got started with him. He was feeling a bit more padded these days, now that Julius had him eating regular meals.

Julius let his fingers wander up to Malcolm's nipples. They were not all that sensitive ordinarily, but they could be coaxed into stiffness, which Julius liked. Down, down to his ticklish stomach, the fuzz over it, thickening as Julius stroked his way even further down. The band of his boxers, the patch of damp over the head of his penis, and there, hidden away, the penis itself. Lovely, tempting, penises were They tasted good, they felt good, they were such pleasure to hold in his hand, to stroke. Julius had known early in his life that the male form was his focus. Malcolm also found women arousing, which they had talked about once, when Julius had been in his cups. He found Malcolm's flexibility baffling. Women didn't have these lovely bollocks, so heavy in his hand, or penises. They didn't have foreskins to play with. "Tits and cunts," Malcolm had said, and shrugged, and they'd abandoned the topic as hopeless. They agreed on the pleasure of giving and receiving oral sex with other men, that was the important point. Even more important: Malcolm wanted to be taken by Julius just as intensely as Julius wanted to take him, which had been where their unconventional relationship had found its start.

Julius let his hand find a little bit of a rhythm, nice and slow, at the pace he knew Malcolm liked, slow and steady.

Malcolm laid a hand over his. "Stop," he said. Julius stopped immediately, and released him as Malcolm tried to sit up.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing, just, I should be doing this for you. Let me blow you, yeah?"

"Hush," Julius said, and pulled him back against his chest, hard. Malcolm struggled for a moment, because that's what Malcolm had to do, then yielded. Julius pinned him in place with one hand and slid his hand into Malcolm's shorts again.

"This is what I need to come tonight," Julius whispered. "I need to feel you come first. I need to hear you. I want you to be a puddle of relaxation when I take you."

"Does that even fucking make sense?" Malcolm said, but he let his head fall back onto Julius's shoulder in submission.

That was not something Malcolm would even want to argue with, Julius knew, because of how deep his need to be used was. Which was again too close to a metaphor for Malcolm's daily life. Well, this was not the time to think about that. This was the time to settle Malcolm down on his lap again, slowly, with a hand holding pulled him back against his chest. He cupped his hand around Malcolm again. Malcolm groaned. Julius bit his lip to keep himself from doing the same. It would be undignified. He was nearly fully clothed and he had his pet on his lap grinding down against his trapped erection, yes, it felt lovely. However, a gentleman did not swear when he was having sex, no matter how how lovely the sounds from his beloved pet were.

"Yes, that's right. Moan for me. Let me know how much you like it, darling."

Malcolm shivered in his arms at the endearment, as he always did. So uncomfortable with the words of affection, yet so starving for them. His half-starved, half-tame wolf, his graying wolf, his pet wolf.
