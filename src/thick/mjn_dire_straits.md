# Dire Straits

Julius paced back and forth across Malcolm's office. "You frightened her, is-- is what I am saying Nicola said to me."

"Why the fuck should I care that I frightened her? I meant to frighten her. I'm supposed to frighten her. Tom *sent* me there to fucking frighten her."

"Yes, and she knows that, and she says it was a bit beyond the usual acceptable levels of frightening. You threaten absurd things; she swears back then falls into line. But this time--"

"This time *what*?"

Malcolm looked a little unhinged at that moment, the whites showing all around his eyes. He shoved forward into Julius, leading with his chin. Julius laid a hand on his chest and pushed to hold him in place. "Malcolm. When were you last at home?"

Malcolm turned away and flung his hands up. "Fucked if I know. Tuesday? I think. Sam will know. Why?"

"When's the last time you ate?"

"How the fuck am I supposed to remember that?"

"Right. We're leaving. Don't bother to take anything. You'll be rather too busy."

"But--"

"Do as I say, Malcolm." Julius put the least, tiniest bit of command into that voice, so Malcolm would take his meaning.

"Fuck," Malcolm said, but Julius could see the relief.

He guided Malcolm into the outer office with a hand on his shoulder. "Sam, I'm taking him home. You should be long since home yourself."

Sam smiled at him and nodded; they had an understanding about what to do when Malcolm allowed himself to reach this sort of state, and Julius was grateful she was discreet. Not that there was anything to hide, but Malcolm's reputation as a terror would suffer, rather, if anyone were to know Julius doted on him quite as much as he did. He texted his own PA word to bring the car around from where he'd been idling waiting for just such an instruction.

Malcolm looked grim in the fluorescent light of the elevator, unshaven, eyes reddened. A muscle in the corner of his jaw was pulsing. His suit was rumpled. He'd begun wearing rather better-fitted jackets in recent months, thanks to Julius's hints and some surprisingly enjoyable expeditions to shops, but he still refused to consider Julius's man on Savile Row. No bespoke anything for Malcolm. Not yet, anyway.

"How angry were you, by the by?" Julius said, at pains to keep his tone casual.

Malcolm chewed at the side of his thumb. "I broke something. Not fucking sure what. Some shite toy she had on her desk."

Julius rubbed his chin but said nothing. Nicola had reported as much; the situation was dire. The elevator doors slid open and he headed out through the security checkpoint to the pavement, confident that Malcolm was following. Once they were out of the government buildings and seated in the back of Julius's car they were two men having a quiet but completely above-board affair, well-known to Tom and to a few other people who mattered. Once they passed the threshold of Julius's London house, they were more than that: two men who had an arrangement that went beyond the conventional. Once the door closed behind them and Julius turned the lock, Malcolm belonged to him.

Julius hung up his overcoat and walked into his ground-floor office without waiting to see if Malcolm followed. If he didn't follow, it would be a sign that drastic measures were needed. That had happened before; it usually meant that Julius had let too much time pass since his last serious session alone with Malcolm. It was entirely possible he was in such a state now. Poor devil, Malcolm. Such a fragile man, really, under the bluster.

He followed this time, however. He took off his jacket and draped it messily over the back of one of Julius's leather  armchairs. Cheeky. Julius ignored it, however.

"I would like you over my desk, please, Malcolm. Trousers down."

Malcolm put his hands on his hips and bared his teeth. "Not going to give me a drink first? Chat me up?"

"If you make me use force I shall be most vexed," Julius said. Malcolm's eyes widened and for a frightening second Julius thought he would have to do it. Then Malcolm's shoulders slumped and he looked down at his feet. He drew in a long deep breath, and then another. Julius gave him the time he needed. There was no sense rushing it. Malcolm would not find peace if he were fighting it all the way.

Eventually, Malcolm spoke. "Yes, sir," he said, simply.

There it was, the first indication of the evening that he was going to yield even though he found it difficult. Julius found himself relaxing. Malcolm went over to the desk. He undid his belt and flies and pushed his trousers down to his ankles. Then he bent himself over Julius's desk and grasped the far edge, most obediently. A satisfying sight, Malcolm Tucker bent over his desk with his arse out, ready for whatever Julius wished to do with it.

Julius ranged himself behind Malcolm and invested a moment in looming, hovering, to ratchet up the tension. Then he nudged at Malcolm's feet, to push them out further, as far as they would go with his clothing still tangled around his ankles. Such a satisfying sight he made, with his arse up, his hardening manhood dangling down between spread thighs. One thing to do, before they began, to get Malcolm further into the headspace Julius wanted him to be in. He took Malcolm's buttocks, forced them apart, and looked. Malcolm went rigid under him, then slowly relaxed.

"Are you clean?"

"What? Fuck, no. No time."

"Could you say that again? I couldn't make out your answer."

Malcolm swore again, under his breath this time. "No, sir. I'm not."

Julius clucked. "We'll deal with that later." A taste of humiliation, barely enough to remind Malcolm of his position, of his role in this relationship. And if Julius found it most satisfying to see Malcolm's ears turn red, that was entirely a side benefit. "Now, what is it that you need right now, Malcolm?"

"You fucking know what I need."

"This may be true, but we have an agreement about it. You are going to use your words to ask for it. Polite words. Respectful words."

Malcolm was silent in response to this. Julius watched him carefully, with all the concern and consideration and careful attention required of a top for his bottom. It was a burden Julius accepted most cheerfully, but at times like this it was difficult.

"Malcolm," he said at last, with warning in his voice.

"Sir."

"Tell me what you need."

"I fucking need to be punished for fucking swearing at you, *sir*. Shit. Fuck. Sorry, sir. Fucking hell, I haven't been home since Tuesday."

"I know."

"Julius. Please. Fucking can't."

Julius laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. Malcolm shuddered and made a sound Julius knew well. Yes, he'd left it too long. It would be harder than usual on both of them, therefore, to make up for his failure to notice that Malcolm was in difficulties. He said, with some emotion in his voice, "Very well, Malcolm."

He paced away to the drawer where he kept the necessities available; there were of course more in the bedroom but he'd found it prudent to keep his office stocked as well. He unlocked it, touched his fingers to his lips for a moment, thinking. The schoolmaster's cane would be right for this. Sharp, attention-getting, leaving bruises that would last for long enough to keep Malcolm calm for days, but not savage. Almost pleasurable, in Julius's recollection. Almost.

"Now, I think ten. For swearing at me, for failing to address me correctly, and for failing to ask for this politely."

Malcolm shuddered. "Fuck. Yes, sir."

"You know my requirements of you. Please do not disappoint me."

Julius opened his mouth to go on, then shut it. He had a deplorable tendency to babble at his moments, from his own nerves as much as anything. He was about to cane another man's bottom, and if he were honest the very idea of it had made his trousers feel too tight. The reality of doing it would make him even more aroused. Another man-- his partner, his boyfriend, his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow pub fighter lover-- would cry out under his blows in another moment. Such a delicious moment, savoring his own anticipation, the trembling fear in the man who'd prostrated himself willingly for this. Another moment, then he could wait no more. Julius raised the cane, judged the desirable force carefully, then made himself swing harder. It came down across Malcolm's buttocks and the sound was simply marvelous.

Malcolm jerked and squawked. "Fuck! The fuck was that?"

"Tch," said Julius.

Malcolm swiveled around and glared at him. Julius held that gaze, implacable, arms folded, cane in hand. Malcolm blinked first. He let his forehead come down on the desk and tightened his fingers on the end of the desk so hard his fingers went white. Julius counted his breaths: three, four. Then Malcolm released his grip, returned to position, and nodded.

"My apologies, sir," he said, and his voice was strained. "It won't happen again."

"I'm sure it won't," Julius said, "but we shall add on two strokes as a guarantee."

A noisy breath blown out that Julius chose to ignore; Malcolm would regret it enough for now. Then Malcolm said, with something approximating respect, "Yes, sir, thank you, sir."

Julius raised the cane and brought it down again. Such a satisfying sensation this was for him, the noise, the feeling of impact, the sound it made against Malcolm's buttocks, the sounds Malcolm made in the moments afterward, as Julius gave him time to let the pain flood through him, the endorphins flow, his brain-state change. By the twelfth stroke Malcolm was keening and pleading with him for something unnamed, possibly unnameable, but something only Julius could give him. Something he needed desperately. Something Julius wished to give him to equally desperately.

Julius set the cane down and went to him, clasped his shoulders, stroked his hair. There he was, Malcolm Tucker, with tears dripping from his nose, breath coming fast. His jaw was no longer clenched. Something had released in him in those last few strokes. That was the trick of it, for Julius, watching his partner carefully for the moment when it was enough, when the goal had been achieved.

Julius helped Malcolm stand up again, unsteadily, and held him close.

"What that what you needed, Malcolm?"

Malcolm closed his eyes, nodded. Julius dabbed at his face with a handkerchief, dried his tears carefully. Malcolm remained still for this, hands resting against Julius's chest. Julius touched fingers under his chin and tipped up his face. He kissed Malcolm, and there it was, that sweet pliancy that Malcolm only achieved after he'd been whipped, that surrender he craved but could not allow himself without Julius's permission. He opened his mouth for Julius and closed his eyes and kissed him in return so gently, so openly, so-- if Julius dared to think it-- soulfully, with his anger at last purged. Or if not that, if that was impossible in a man as knotted up as Malcolm, at least his anger was submerged for the nonce.

Julius slipped a hand down Malcolm's back, slipped under his shirttail, and cupped a buttock. Hot to the touch, and Malcolm sucked in a breath involuntarily. Lovely. Simply perfect. Julius was himself deeply aroused, and feeling a rather urgent desire for more physical contact with Malcolm, for the feeling of his body underneath, those heated buttocks against his thighs. It was not yet time to act on that need, however. The night was nowhere near over, and Julius would not consider it over until both he and his lover were satisfied, well fed, clean, and warm in bed together (Malcolm of course nude).

More work to do. Pleasurable work, to be sure. Julius cradled Malcolm in his arms and sighed.

# The Right Word

Julius tugged Malcolm close and encouraged him to lay his head on Julius's shoulder. Malcolm shivered and complied. He allowed himself the indulgence of his hand remaining on that firm buttock, his fingers tracing along the heated welts he'd left there. The schoolmaster's cane had indeed been perfect. Malcolm was as yet trembling against him, but was not so wrung out as to be finished for the evening. He would find an excuse to use it again, but in the meantime--they were, as he had just phrased it, not yet finished. He had yet more business with his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow-pub-fighter lover, whatever the right word for him was. Malcolm used the word "master" for him sometimes, but none of the words Julius had tried for Malcolm were quite right. "Slave", for example, was completely inappropriate to describe a man who would argue with him even when he was being spanked.

The precise word didn't matter to Julius, however. What mattered was continuing to care for Malcolm.

"Now, Malcolm," Julius said, "I want you to undress all the way. Leave your clothing here, folded. Then go upstairs and take a shower and clean yourself out for me. Thoroughly. Plug yourself with the black plug, the large one. Then join me in the kitchen. Should have some dinner ready for you."

"Not sure I'm hungry."

"I know you're not sure, but I'm your master. And I know what you need."

"Yeah. Okay."

"Malcolm, I require formality from you tonight. Until I release you, if you please, you will address me properly."

Malcolm pulled back from his embrace and looked up at him, a little uncertain. Such a lovely face he had, sharp and intent and wolfish, so beautiful when he'd been crying and his lashes were wet and his eyes red-rimmed. Then he looked down, a little bashful, and said, "Yes, sir. Sorry, sir."

"You are forgiven. Go, that is to say, hop to it, please."

Julius took himself off to the kitchen to put together a little something for the pair of them, leaving Malcolm alone in his office to undress. It was a pleasant show to watch, but Julius wanted to give him a little time to recover himself. The evening had, after all, many hours left in it, and Julius was not quite finished with him. If he was right--and he suspected he was--Malcolm had not yet truly surrendered. He was holding himself back even after the caning. He might have released his fury with Nicola from earlier in the day, but it had been going on all week, hadn't it? Not home since Tuesday. That was far longer than he was supposed to let it go. He'd promised Julius faithfully he wouldn't push himself so. He was, in fact, supposed to have texted Julius to tell him if he'd gone more than a day without sleep.

Julius moved a pan from hob to the side and clucked. He'd botched this, rather. He ought to have checked in with Malcolm. Instead he'd allowed himself to get involved in that series of meetings in Den Hague, meetings that somebody else could easily have attended. He could have come back an entire day earlier than he had.

His brooding was interrupted by the sound of Malcolm clearing his throat.

"Sir," he said.

Julius smiled at him, because it was, as ever, lovely to see Malcolm clean-shaven, scrubbed pink, hair still damp and sticking up. He was nude and slightly uncomfortable to be so, standing there in Julius's lovely modern kitchen under hanging copper pans. His erection had waned, and his hands were clasped in front of himself as if to hide it. Submissive, yes, but not yet fully in the frame of mind Julius needed him in.

"Hands in the small of your back, please. And turn around so I can see your plug. Ah, good. That's the one I meant. Did you clean yourself in the shower?"

Malcolm did not quite hate the douches, but he found Julius's insistence on them maddening. Certainly he hated being watched doing it, or having it done to him while he submitted. Periodically Julius had to renew that experience of humiliation, as it was one of the things Malcolm had requested from him specifically. The subjugation of his body to Julius's wishes. The subjugation of himself. Of his own will to that of his owner. The man who cared for him, in all senses.

Now, at Julius's question, his face flushed dark red and he hung his head. "Yes, sir," he said.

"How many times?"

"Three times. Sir."

"Very good. Do you think you are able to sit down to eat your dinner?"

Malcolm looked at the tall wooden stools in Julius's kitchen, at their leather-padded tops. "Think so, sir."

Julius gestured toward the nearest stood and watched. Malcolm bit his lip but he could not contain his wince or the little breath that escaped him as he adjusted his position on the stool. Julius smiled. He might as well admit the base physical pleasure he felt in response to the expression on Malcolm's face. It was one of the many things he himself found to enjoy in this relationship, even beyond the affection he felt for Malcolm and the joy he found in caring for him and tending to him. Malcolm was a wild animal, a tight-wound bundle of nerves who would always be more effective than Julius at the day-to-day exigencies of his job. He needed gentle handling, however. He needed his steady PA Sam, his surprisingly solid lieutenant MacDonald, and he needed his lover.

Keeping him on an even keel took a lot of work. Whipping him to serenity took a lot of work. Surely it was acceptable that Julius could allow himself to enjoy watching him sit on his bruised backside and wince.

Malcolm looked up at him and smiled sardonically. He knew what Julius was watching for. He looked down at the marble countertop, at the cup of consommé Julius set before him. Nothing spicy, bland food, safe food, suitable for a man who had likely been surviving on a diet of caffeine and sugar for the last three days. A bit of broth and some good French bread, steamed vegetables. Water with lime in it. Light fare, nothing to sit heavily in the stomach afterward. Julius was tempted to feed Malcolm with his own hands--he had done this before and Malcolm had loathed it with every fiber of his being--but it didn't feel right for tonight. Tonight he would restrain himself to making sure Malcolm had everything he wished to engaging him in small talk, and to attempting to coax from Malcolm some sort of reason why he'd let himself get to the state he'd been in without contacting Julius for help.

There were, however, no answers to be had from Malcolm. He was obedient to the letter of Julius's instructions, scrupulous in how he addressed his master, but not forthcoming in the least. Julius cleared the counter enough that the houseboy wouldn't find too much of a mess in the morning, and sighed. His trial wasn't over. Malcolm's trial or his own? It would be a trial for the both of them.

"The bedroom, please," Julius said.

Malcolm preceded him up the stairs so Julius could enjoy the sight of his arms folded behind his back, the livid red stripes across his thighs. He waited at the foot of Julius's grand bed quietly, head down, but his eyes followed Julius almost anxiously. Julius had given him no hints about what was to follow, and indeed he would give no hints until it was upon them. He might, after all, lose his own heart. But his agreement with Malcolm required that he steel himself for it.

Julius methodically removed his jacket, tie, and shoes. He tucked his cufflinks away in their velvet box and rolled his shirtsleeves neatly to mid-forearm. He removed his watch and set it on his dresser. He flexed the fingers of his right hand. Was he ready for this? He was.

He turned to Malcolm, who was motionless in position, but tense and no longer looking at him. Julius went up to him and took his chin in hand and tipped it up to force Malcolm to meet his eyes.

"We shall now deal with the matter of your misbehavior during the week. You did not contact me and ask for assistance, as you expressly agreed to do the last time this happened."

Malcolm's brows furrowed. "You were too busy."

"What did I just hear?" Warning signals in his voice, and Malcolm blinked rapidly.

"You seemed too busy, *sir*. I didna want tae bother you, off on your trip."

"That's not good enough, Malcolm. You know better. Now, why didn't you contact me and at least talk with me on the phone?"

"I will next time, sir. Sorry, sir. The caning made your point."

"The caning was clearly not enough. I'm going to have to spank you until I get an honest response from you."

Malcolm's eyes widened and he looked as if he were about to protest. Then he thought better of it. Julius had taught him successfully that resistance only made it worse. "Sir," he said, and set his jaw.

"Shall we begin?"

"Sir." No fear yet, only stubborn resentment. Well, he would need to learn.

Julius sat on his bed, back against the headboard, legs outstretched. He preferred this position to a straight chair or stool, though those had their advantages. Malcolm laid himself over Julius's lap at a mere gesture of command. They'd done this many times. Malcolm had resisted it at first, balked at the position, begged for the desk instead. The intimacy of it, perhaps, frightened him. Certainly he could hide nothing from Julius when he was this close to him, so close that Julius could feel his every quiver, his every breath. Julius nudged him gently so his thighs were spread wide, exposing everything: that heavy ballsack, the erection that was beginning to make itself known again, the base of the plug.

"Now," Julius said, "Clasp your hands at the back of your neck and do not move them until you have permission."

Malcolm shuddered but obeyed.

Julius opened his mouth to make another little speech at Malcolm about what he was about to do, then shut his mouth again. It was a terrible flaw, this urge he had. Instead, he ought to simply raise his hand and bring it down on Malcolm's backside, hard. He hardened his resolve and did so.

Ah, there it was, the sound, the feeling of heat exploding against his palm, the jerk Malcolm made over his knees. Left cheek, right cheek, pause. Listen to Malcolm's harsh breathing hitch and recover. Then again a pair of blows, lower down, a moment to let the pain wash over Malcolm. Again, even lower. And again, the slaps landing on Malcolm's thighs now, as hard as Julius dared.

That wrested a whimper from him. Julius paused and let his hand rest on that deliciously reddened backside. He let his fingers slide between Malcolm's cheeks, delicately, paused on the base of the plug to play with it, then down far enough to tease his bollocks. Malcolm was trembling against him and yes, there were tears on his face again.

"How are you feeling, Malcolm?" Julius asked. It was, perhaps, the question Malcolm feared most.

"My arse hurts, sir." His voice was rough, but there was resistance in it yet.

"Why didn't you contact me this week?"

"Sir," Malcolm said. "No fucking idea."

This was what he'd anticipated when he'd acknowledged to himself that it would be hard on both of them. Malcolm had been whipped hard enough that he'd been brought to tears earlier, and now he was weeping again. His buttocks and thighs were hot to the touch, and so was Julius's right palm. But it was not enough to make up for Julius's neglect. It had been own damn fault Malcolm had thought he was too busy, and now he had to do this until the both of them were completely wrung out.

"We will continue until you're able to tell me."

And he continued, harder now and faster than before, giving Malcolm no respite, no time to recover and breathe. If brutality was required, Julius would rise to the occasion and be brutal. His hand burned, but he raised it and spanked, over and over. Malcolm writhed under him, keened, swore, but his hands stayed clasped, he remained in position. And then something shifted, something broke, and Malcolm went limp. His shoulders were shaking.

"Sir," Malcolm was saying, repeating it over and over. "Julius. Sir. Please, sir, hold me. Fucking hold me. Fucking need you."

There it was, there was what Julius had wanted to see, Malcolm completely unwound, weeping helplessly, shaking in Julius's arms, burrowing his face into Julius's neck, clinging tight. Julius held him and rocked him, listened to his half-coherent tale of the week, of how stupid they all were, how not a single one of them was worthy of running the nation, of how much Malcolm worried and how helpless he was, and how many mistakes he'd made and how nothing he did was any good. The shame of it, of failing again and letting a story go out unchecked in the press about something utterly pointless. Julius listened, soothed him, wiped the tears from his face and the snot from his nose and kissed him. Kissed his hair, his eyes, his temples, his lips, kissed him until Malcolm was free of his burdens and quiet again in Julius's arms.

This was, if he confessed it, the part Julius liked best.

He laid Malcolm face down on the bed and tended to him. Salve for his legs and backside, a clean handkerchief for his tears, kisses for his hair. Malcolm blew his nose and lay patiently while Julius soothed all the hurts he'd just inflicted. No salve for his own hand, though. He let that burn him as a reminder that he couldn't let Malcolm go that long ungrounded ever again. Even a quiet dinner with him would have kept him calm, but no, Julius had allowed himself to be busy, allowed himself to stay that extra day to meet with the EU official who wanted a favor. Damned fool.

Julius left Malcolm on the bed and got up to undress himself. Shirt, socks, trousers, freeing his erection from confinement at last. He returned and touched Malcolm's shoulder. "What would you like next, Malcolm?"

"Julius," Malcolm said. "Are we still formal?"

"Yes."

"Sir, can I--sir, I'd like to suck you off."

Malcolm didn't necessarily need to come on these nights, and indeed sometimes had difficulty doing so. Too worn, too tired, too hungry. Julius did not find joy in demanding that Malcolm do something he genuinely found trying without any pleasure. Obedience, yes, Malcolm had admitted--reluctantly, after much patient work from Julius in providing a safe environment--that he found pleasure in obeying Julius, no matter how much a struggle it was. So Julius strove to meet this need with structure, rules, and punishments. But orgasms? Those were reserved for nights when it was easy for Malcolm, when he wasn't a strung-out mess.

He did feel strongly about Julius's orgasms, however. He almost insisted on them. It was as if he judged himself, found himself wanting, if the man he had submitted to did not find pleasure with him. Julius found this need easy enough to accede to. Especially after he'd bruised his bare hand against Malcolm's backside. Oh, especially then, as now.

"Not tonight," Julius said. "Tonight I want to take you."

And that was a smile on Malcolm's face, there for an instant before Malcolm was craning up for another long slow kiss. Julius bade him remove the plug, and he did so while Julius watched. No embarrassment any more, no sense of reserve left in him. He was soft, pliant. He'd surrendered.

It was such pleasure to roll a condom onto himself. It was such a thrill to watch Malcolm lie back on the bed, reddened arse over the edge, and raise and spread his legs without being asked. In a moment Julius would receive his own reward for labor, his own moment of release. He considered for a moment indulging Malcolm's occasional wish for dry penetration, then decided against it this time. He himself liked it very wet, very slippery, almost messy. He used a generous handful of slick on himself, on Malcolm's arsehole. Only then did Julius let himself take him.

Penetration. Penis in hand, guiding himself into Malcolm's already-opened body, pressing into him deep, all the way in. Julius let himself move inside his Malcolm, his beloved, his difficult prickly awkward Glasgow-pub-fighter lover, and groaned with the pleasure. Malcolm was open, warm, soft, and he moaned as Julius took him. Thighs hot to the touch, hand-prints visible as well as the livid stripes from the schoolmaster's cane--oh so beautiful. Julius told Malcolm so, and Malcolm thanked him and called him sir. There was genuine openness in his voice at last, which was good, very good. He was hard but was not touching himself, of course. He'd raised a hand to his mouth and was biting at the side of his thumb. It was beautiful. He was beautiful. Malcolm was beautiful. His, his--what word could he use for Malcolm? His charge. His, his pet. That's what he was.

Julius said, "I have finally found the word. You are my pet. You're not just my property. You're my pet."

"I--oh, fuck, yes, that's what I am, fuck. Your pet."

Which was not as respectful as Julius might have liked, but the sentiment was admirable. Malcolm had endured enough and had finally been broken down and Julius could overlook it. It was far more pleasurable to move inside him, to push up against those bruised thighs and watch Malcolm wince, to watch the war between pleasure and pain on his face be won by pleasure at last. Julius looked down and watched himself move inside Malcolm. The place where they were joined, Malcolm stretched open around him, the friction, the pressure, the pleasure. He moved harder and faster, as hard as he could, driving deep into his pet's body, heedless of everything save his own needs in this moment.

"Fucking do it, Julius, sir, do it, please. Come inside me. Fucking use me. Use your pet."

"Say it again."

"I'm your pet. Your pet."

That was enough to send him over, that word on Malcolm's lips. Julius let his eyes close and his head fall back and it was there, his orgasm was upon him, and he was spending himself inside his pet, falling forward over him.

Later, when they were both showered and warm and clean, ready to go to bed together at last, Malcolm knelt up next to him. He took Julius's right hand gently and examined it, hissed out an expletive. Then he surprised Julius by bending his head and kissing his palm with as much reverence as Julius had ever seen from him.

"Thank you," he said.

Julius could not speak for a moment, he was so moved. Eventually he said, "The pleasure was mine."

"Not all yours. I feel good even if I fucking won't be able to sit tomorrow. Fuck."

Julius pulled Malcolm down so his head was pillowed on Julius's chest. He pulled the duvet up over them both and switched off the light. Comfort and warmth at last. He did so love these ends to their evenings, he in silk pajamas, Malcolm nude beside him, in his arms. His pet, in his arms.

"Malcolm. The word *pet*. Are you all right with that, that word? That description of our relationship?"

A moment of silence while Julius stroked Malcolm's hair. Then, "Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay with it. But yeah, I -- feels right, somehow."

"Ownership, responsibility. Obedience in return."

"That's it. So long as I'm not a pet lapdog or some shite like that."

"A wolf, I think. Yes, you are my pet Scottish wolf."

"There are no fucking wolves in Scotland."

"Are you quite sure?"

"None for hundreds of years."

"They're all in London now, perhaps."

"Fucking flatterer."

"My pet wolf. I shall have to give you something to wear that says this."

"So long as you don't put a radio tag in my ear."

"Nothing so drastic. Something you can wear when we're alone."

"Oh, now I see what you're after, you kinky cunt. You just want to lock a collar on me and tie me to the end of the bed."

"Don't tempt me," Julius said, and he heard Malcolm laughing at last.

# Down Time

It was, as all of Julius's presents to Malcolm were, discreet. Wolf's-head cufflinks, nothing large or gaudy or likely to trigger Malcolm's class rage or invite questions. Cufflinks for moments when Malcolm dressed for the occasion. He would decline to mention that he'd commissioned them, which knowledge would make Malcolm self-conscious about the cost. It was no matter. Malcolm was worth quite a bit more.

Malcolm looked up at him from the little velvet box in his hand and curled his lip. "Your wolf, eh?"

"My wolf."

And Malcolm was leaning in and giving Julius a kiss and that was gratifying because it was entirely open and sincere and lingering. The box was tucked into his jacket pocket and he had his arms around Julius's waist. Julius curled his fingers into Malcolm's hair, tilted his head, got his tongue into Malcolm's mouth. It was, all in all, good. What would be better would be lying on the couch with Malcolm cradled against him.

Julius gently disentangled himself from Malcolm's embrace and led him the rest of the way into his study, his sanctum sanctorum. Julius sat on the couch and kicked his shoes off. Malcolm went to the sideboard and poured him a glass of whisky, carried it back to him and bowed as he handed it over. There was a gleam in his eye, that feral glint that Julius adored so, but muted for now. Julius swiveled so his legs were stretched out along the cushions and beckoned Malcolm over. Shoes off, jacket off, and Malcolm lay himself back in Julius's arms, between his legs, cushioned against Julius's regrettably comfortable belly. Julius kissed the back of his head, took a sip of the single malt Malcolm had chosen, and made a satisfied noise.

"Sybaritic cunt," Malcolm said. "S'pose I am in no position to complain."

Julius pressed his hand against his chest and said, "How are you feeling tonight?" This was a question he demanded an answer to, no matter how much Malcolm might hate it.

There was the sigh, but then Malcolm laid his hand over Julius's and laced his fingers with his.

"Was nae a bad week," he said. "Nic'la was almost sensible. And Tom did well at questions after some truly fucking intensive prep, so he's feeling good and I'm feeling good. All's well in Whitehall."

Julius kissed the back of his neck, just below the fringe of hair. Malcolm had rather lovely hair when he let it grow, but he kept it close-cropped. A symbol of the control he had to exert over himself, perhaps. He said, a trifle indistinctly through a mouthful of whisky, "I trust your lieutenant is mollified?"

"Jamie has decided he still believes in me, yeah. Fuck knows why. I mishandled him. He's my fucking friend and I didna treat him like one. Cunt's sensitive like a little girl, yeah? Took him out for a drink and sorted it."

"The confusion with Treasury?"

Malcolm waved his free hand. "Sorted *that* two days ago. They saw it my way in the end. Still, happy it's Friday night. Happy to be here."

"Mmm," Julius said. He slipped his forefinger into the space between the button of Malcolm's shirt and his trousers and touched his skin. Malcolm made a pleased sound. Cuddling, he was cuddling his pet wolf of a Friday night and it was rather wonderful.

"And how was your week, Julz?"

"Acceptable. I have hopes Tom will see reason on the banking regulations, but he's reluctant. I am feeling nervy about the markets in some respect. Over-leverage, too much risk. Iceland in particular is rather mad about borrowing. I shall likely divest."

"You know best about that shite."

"There are men I know in the City who know considerably better. I'm taking hints from some of the more cautious among them. The fellows who've been doing it for a few decades."

The topic was, however, tedious. Another sip of whisky, and the warm glow commenced its spread through his blood. Julius felt himself begin to relax at last, truly relax. Malcolm was in good case; he'd been delighted by his present. They would end their evening with love-making. Julius found himself of a mind to get started on that happy project soon. He kissed the back of Malcolm's neck again.

"Fuck," Malcolm said, and he wriggled himself closer to Julius. "Feel like I'm in fucking heaven."

Julius set the whisky tumbler aside and tugged at Malcolm's tie to loosen it. "I should hope so. I work rather hard to make you feel that way."

"Fuck knows why."

"I'm quite ridiculously fond of you," Julius said. He got the tie worked free and commencing undoing Malcolm's shirt buttons. Malcolm's backside was firmly pressed against his hips, and that was most pleasurable. Most. Arousingly so. He had a mind to defer his own gratification until later, however. He would indulge himself by fussing over Malcolm some more.

The shirt was now unbuttoned. Malcolm obligingly pulled the tails free of his trousers, so Julius could explore his bare chest at his leisure. Bare chest, narrow chest. Skin and bones, at least when Julius had got started with him. He was feeling a bit more padded these days, now that Julius had him eating regular meals.

Julius let his fingers wander up to Malcolm's nipples. They were not all that sensitive ordinarily, but they could be coaxed into stiffness, which Julius liked. Down, down to his ticklish stomach, the fuzz over it, thickening as Julius stroked his way even further down. The band of his boxers, the patch of damp over the head of his penis, and there, hidden away, the penis itself. Lovely, tempting, penises were. They tasted good, they felt good, they were such pleasure to hold in his hand, to stroke. Julius had known early in his life that the male form was his focus. Malcolm also found women arousing, which they had talked about once, when Julius had been in his cups. He found Malcolm's flexibility baffling. Women didn't have these lovely bollocks, so heavy in his hand, or penises like Malcolm's, so thick. They didn't have foreskins to play with. "Tits and cunts," Malcolm had said, and shrugged, and they'd abandoned the topic as hopeless; no mutual understanding was possible. They agreed on the pleasure of giving and receiving oral sex with other men, that was the important point. Even more important: Malcolm wanted to be taken by Julius just as intensely as Julius wanted to take him, which had been where their unconventional relationship had found its start.

Julius let his hand find a little bit of a rhythm, at the pace he knew Malcolm liked, slow and steady.

Malcolm laid a hand over his. "Stop," he said. Julius stopped immediately, and released him as Malcolm tried to sit up.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing, just, I should be doing this for you. Let me blow you, yeah?"

"Hush," Julius said, and pulled him back against his chest, hard. Malcolm struggled for a moment, because that's what Malcolm had to do, then yielded. Julius pinned him in place with one hand and slid his hand into Malcolm's shorts again.

"This is what I need to come tonight," Julius whispered. "I need to feel you come first. I need to hear you. I want you to be a puddle of relaxation when I take you."

"Does that even fucking make sense?" Malcolm said, but he let his head fall back onto Julius's shoulder in submission.

That was not something Malcolm would even want to argue with, Julius knew, because of how deep his need to be used was. Which was again too close to a metaphor for Malcolm's daily life. Well, this was not the time to think about that. This was the time to settle Malcolm down on his lap again, slowly, with a hand holding pulled him back against his chest. He cupped his hand around Malcolm again. Malcolm groaned. Julius bit his lip to keep himself from doing the same. It would be undignified. He was nearly fully clothed and he had his pet on his lap grinding down against his trapped erection, yes, it felt lovely. However, a gentleman did not swear when he was having sex, no matter how how lovely the sounds from his beloved pet were.

"Yes, that's right. Moan for me. Let me know how much you like it, darling."

Malcolm shivered in his arms at the endearment, as he always did. So uncomfortable with the words of affection, yet so starving for them. His half-starved, half-tame wolf, his graying wolf, his pet wolf.

# Wolf

The other items Julius commissioned for Malcolm took a little more time than the cufflinks. For one thing, he took more pains finding the right craftsman for them, for he wanted them to be perfect. For another, the jeweler had to finish the wolf's head inlays on the hardware, not to mention the engraving, before the leatherworker could finish. But all was arranged in less time than he feared, though more time than he wanted, and he had everything ready in a box, nestled in black tissue paper, wrapped in a lovely bit of geometric printed paper Julius had come across in Berlin recently.

The box was sitting on the mantel in Julius's study, waiting for an evening when they were both free. Malcolm had had a rather trying week, unfortunately, and had been up all hours drilling Tom for what all expected to be a particularly trying Prime Minister's Questions on the topic of the NHS. This, unlike the shenanigans of the minor ministries, mattered, so Julius stayed quietly out of the way and kept himself occupied getting Treasury to justify some of its more hidebound accounting policies.

On Wednesday evening, after it was done with, Julius collected Malcolm for an early-ish exit from Whitehall, a spot of dinner out, and then an evening together. Dinner was a light affair at a little French-Anglo place Julius knew that hadn't yet been overrun, tucked into a little cul-de-sac in Notting Hill near his place. Julius ordered for them both, because Malcolm didn't care about food the way he did. Malcolm was in fine case, boasting about how well his man Tom had done. Still on a high from success, in Julius's judgement, not yet able to slow down, but not overwound and fractious.

"He led that twerpy little Tory cunt right into his trap and zoom!" Malcolm's hand shot off into the air and then came down with a chop. "It was almost like he had a working brain. So fucking proud of him."

He picked up his glass of fizzy water and swigged it down with gusto. Everything about him made Julius want to smile, so he did.

"What the fuck are you beaming at?"

"You," said Julius, and he took a sip of his wine.

Malcolm rolled his eyes and picked up his fork at last. "What the fuck is this? Which animal's guts am I about to eat?"

"Chicken, and not the innards, as you well know. When *did* you last eat?" Julius asked, with studied casualness.

"Sam shoved a muffin down my throat this morning. I think you've bribed her."

"I have indeed," Julius said. A simple thing to do, an obvious thing, to ingratiate one's self with one's partner's PA. Malcolm had done as much with Julius's assistant, winning him over with a stream of tickets for West End shows. Sam had a weakness for a particular brand of sought-after cosmetics; not Julius's line of country, but he knew a fellow who knew someone whose line it was. And thus Sam was in his pocket, his willing accomplice at the game of keeping Malcolm balanced.

Malcolm was a man who did not want to be balanced, so it was a constant fight. A pleasurable fight. It was, in fact, Julius's chief pleasure in a rather lovely life.

Dinner was also pleasurable, as were all dinners when Malcolm was feeling satisfied with himself. He was relaxed, witty, charming. He flirted with the waitstaff of both sexes and made them laugh. He consented to hold Julius's hand on the cab ride home, which was a ridiculous concession given his dislike of public displays of anything. He was in such a good mood that he slid immediately into the mode of an obedient pet when they passed through the door, without needing prompting or even putting up his usual token resistance. He removed Julius's raincoat gracefully and hung it on the coat-stand before removing his own. Then he opened the door of Julius's study and bowed him through.

Malcolm went to the liquor case without being asked and poured him a dram of something. It didn't matter what; everything Julius had was drinkable, but whatever this was, Malcolm put a splash of soda into it. He carried the glass over to him and went to his knees.

"Sir," he said, and Julius found himself blinking back unexpected tears. Such devotion. Such service. He touched Malcolm's lips with a finger in thanks and took the glass. He drank once, deeply. When he lowered the glass Malcolm was on his feet again, but watching him almost suspiciously.

"Jesus, Julius, you're as jumpy as a cat in a kennel."

"Really, now."

"Fucking really. All night. What the fuck is gnawing on your bawbag?"

Now they came to it. Now Julius found out if his overtures would be rejected.

"There's something for you on the mantel," he said.

"A gift? You're a fucking clucking hen over a gift?"

"Yes, I'm afraid I am."

"Your last one went over well." Malcolm raised his arm and pointed to his shirt-cuff, where indeed the little black wolf's head blinked.

"This one's rather different. Go on, open it."

Julius let himself take another drink because he was, yes, nervous about this. Malcolm might refuse. Malcolm might laugh at him. Malcolm might mock the excess of emotion Julius was feeling about this whole affair. He listened to the paper ripping and then to the rustle of the tissue. Then silence.

He looked up. Malcolm was holding the item that had been on top. It was a black leather dog collar, with sturdy rings all around and a post that one could thread a lock through to prevent it being removed. The hardware was not stainless but instead platinum. The first dog tag depending from the ring had Malcolm's name on its and a wolf's head in onyx; the second tag had Julius's monogram on it.

Malcolm turned it over and over in his hands, buckled and unbuckled it. It was no mere strip of leather cut with harsh edges, but instead a lovely bit of work. The leather was wonderfully soft and supple, Julius knew. He'd held it in his own hands, tried it on around his own neck to be sure Malcolm would not be harmed by it.

"Fuck," Malcolm said. "This is--"

"For you."

"Of course it's for my fucking throat. What does it mean?"

Julius stood and went over to him, glass in hand. "We're partners outside this home, lovers in the conventional sense. Inside this home you are my submissive. I propose a further deepening of our arrangement."

"Yeah?"

"When you wear the collar, you are my pet. My wolf. My pack mate. I expect your complete submission to me. Inasmuch as a wolf ever submits."

Malcolm showed his teeth briefly at this comment, which reflected another core truth of their relationship. While Malcolm did wish to submit, and in the end always would, Julius still had to earn it. Over and over. And enforce it. The well-used leather strap in his desk drawer was the best proof of this he had.

Malcolm turned over the collar in his hands again and fidgeted with the tags. His brows were together.

Julius said, "There's something else in the box."

Malcolm gave him a look he couldn't read, and set the collar on the mantel beside the box. He reached in and removed another layer of tissue paper to take out the second item. Julius had hidden this in its own nest of paper.

"A leash? A whip?"

"Both. It's a German dog whip. You see how clever it is--the way the braid parts here, near the end, to form a loop for my wrist, the snap hook at the end of the handle to attach to your collar. This is a particularly heavy braid, meant to be used with more difficult dog breeds. Huskies, malamutes, wolf hybrids, that sort of thing."

"Wolf," Malcolm said. "The fucking wolf again."

"And you can see here on the handle--"

"Your monogram and the wolf head. You and me."

"I had them both made for you. The same artist as made your cufflinks." He was babbling. He knew he was babbling. Nerves, and his usual tendency to run on. No wonder Malcolm was staring at him. He stopped himself and said, carefully, "Do you like them?"

"Yes, I fucking like them! I just, I need to know--I'm your pet, yeah? Wearing this means I'm your pet?"

"It's a great deal to ask, I realize. Likely you need to time to think about it."

"Think about it? Been fucking thinking about nothing else since the other night. Fuck knows what the MI5 makes of my Google searches in the last week. Fuck knows what *I* make of them."

"If you have questions--"

"Course I fucking have questions, you twat. Do you expect me to be on all fours or some shit like that?"

"Only if I specifically request it."

Malcolm rubbed at the back of his neck. "Fuck. Formal when I've got it on?"

"No, I think not. Not unless I instruct you specifically. It's quite--Well, I've also been reading a great deal about pet play. About the responsibilities of a master toward his wolf. I am prepared to take them seriously. It is only a short step beyond what we've been doing already. Obedience and discipline, submission. A firm hand to keep you in line. Only now I will have you collared and leashed."

"You *are* going to chain me up at the foot of the bed."

"You did request it."

"I didn't fucking request it."

Julius rolled his eyes at him. Malcolm mentioning it had, as they both well knew, been a tacit invitation that he had wanted Julius to hear and respond to. Malcolm grimaced at him.

"What if I need a slash?"

"Wake me and I'll walk you."

"*Fuck* me. Fucking cunting hell, Julius."

"Do you truly object or are you just making a lot of noise?"

Malcolm paced away from him. Julius folded his arms and waited. Malcolm deserved to be able to think. Julius didn't want to make his partner endure this without pleasure. There went the hand at the back of his neck, rubbing. That was one of his tells--he *was* thinking and he was uncertain about what to do next. Julius found himself wanting to bite his nails. This was why he'd been nervous. Malcolm as his submissive was one thing, a comfortable thing for the two of them. Even playing with using the word pet was not far removed from what they'd been doing. Collaring Malcolm, treating him like a half-wild wolf and chaining him up--asking him to play the pet in a deeper way--that was something else. Malcolm had to want it. Had to consent to it.

Would he?

Julius found where he'd left his glass and drank the rest of his whisky down.

Malcolm came back to him, took the empty glass away from him, and set it aside. He had the collar in his hands again. He went to his knees and bent to kiss Julius's boots. This was--he would do it when instructed to, but Julius had never seen him do it before unprompted. That meant--that meant--was he apologizing for the refusal he was about to deliver?

"Julius."

"Malcolm."

Malcolm held the collar up to him. "I accept your collar. I will be your pet wolf."

Julius let out a long breath. "Thank you."

"Do we--Will you put it on me now?"

"Upstairs, I think. I'd like you to be completely undressed when I see you in it the first time."

Malcolm flashed a smile at him. "I was hoping we'd fuck tonight."

Julius smiled back. "You'll get your wish, if you behave. Stay on all fours as you follow me up, if you please."

"I knew you'd say that, ya kinky cunt."

The obscenity was welcome to him, because it meant Malcolm was relaxing into his decision and was feeling playful. Julius decided to stay with this mood. Playfulness, yes. It wasn't all serious and intense, after all. Laughing with a happy Malcolm in his arms was--well, it was perhaps his greatest pleasure in life.

He walked out of the study then had to stop to wait for Malcolm to catch up. The expression on his face made Julius smile and then hide the smile away because, oh my, such thunderous rage on his face as he realized what staying on all fours entailed. And then the obscenities muttered under his breath. He was seeking for a way to crawl that was not entirely clumsy and demeaning, and he wasn't getting far with it. Julius said nothing to him about this, but let him work through the problem on his own. He turned his back, let the smile show, and took his time ascending the steps. He ignored the muttered stream of curses behind him.

Once in the bedroom, he watched Malcolm undress with a little smile hidden behind his hand. Malcolm was entirely awkward about it, because he could not stand to remove his trousers. And of course as he stripped he revealed that he was entirely aroused already, from anticipation or from the mind-space the crawl up the stairs had put him in. So was Julius, but he made no mention of it. He'd savor it for a while before they went to bed.

"Kneel up, please."

Malcolm knelt up and folded his arms behind his back. He watched Julius with all of his attention. Julius cleared his throat, opened his mouth to say something about what the moment meant to him, then shut his mouth again. Silence, Nicholson. Silence, solemnity.

He wrapped the collar around Malcolm's neck. So soft and supple it was. He threaded the tongue through the buckle and found the right hole for the prong. The security post went through one of the other holes very neatly. It was snug, a good fit. Lovely stitching, well-padded. The rings were stout and well-embedded in the leather. He could use this to quite securely chain Malcolm in place, if he wished to. And he did indeed wish to.

On his dresser was the little lock he'd bought for it. He'd bought several locks, all keyed with the same master, just in case he wished to lock Malcolm up in more ways than this one, but that was perhaps for another day. Through the post it went, and the lock clicked shut. Julius held up the key so Malcolm could see it, then threaded it onto the little keyring he carried daily. Into his trouser pocket they went, and Malcolm's eyes followed them. Julius patted it.

"The leather is waxed. Water-resistant. Intended to be worn for long periods. I'll unlock it tomorrow morning when we leave for Whitehall."

Malcolm nodded. "I'm your dog all night, then. Chained to the bed."

"Chained to the foot of the bed, yes."

"Should I bark for you?" Malcolm said. "Bark bark, fucking bark." And then he actually barked.

"None of that. You're a wolf."

"How about howling?"

Julius clucked his tongue against his teeth. This was entirely too much pushiness from his pet. Time to do something to keep him in check. He clipped the leash to the collar. It was a heavier leather braid than anyone would use for a dog, much more like something he imagined one would use on a wild animal. The weight was most satisfying in his hand, as was the stoutness of the handle. The length was just enough to keep Malcolm tight at his heels. And the expression on Malcolm's face when Julius tugged on it was magnificent. No back-talk about howling now, just dismay.

"Heel," Julius said. He strode across the bedroom a few times, tugging Malcolm after him. There went the muttered obscenities as Malcolm struggled to keep up.

"I see we shall have to practice this. A bit of training this weekend, perhaps. And a bit of chastisement to teach you to keep your mouth closed."

"Fuck me."

"Oh, I intend to. But first--first shall we give the whip a try? Nothing serious tonight, I think." A little taste of pain would calm him down and center him, Julius hoped.

"Yeah," Malcolm said. "Whip me like the dog I am."

Julius unclipped the leash again and took it by the handle end. Malcolm remained on his knees, which was a fortunate choice.

"You may stand. Hold the bedpost, please, hands above your head."

Malcolm obeyed instantly, though he did pause to stretch his legs before reaching up. Julius took the opportunity to fondle Malcolm's buttocks and stroke his back. Lovely skin, unmarked by the whip just at present. He wouldn't leave marks on him tonight; he didn't seem to need the steadying of a serious whipping. Just a taste.

"Are you ready, pet?"

"Yeah," Malcolm said.

Julius stepped back. He swung the dog whip once, catching Malcolm across his buttocks where he'd just been touched. He grunted and then shrugged.

"How was that?" Julius said.

"Not sure."

Julius swung again, still completely cautiously, this time aiming across Malcolm's shoulders. He hissed out a breath. Before Malcolm could quite recover, he swung again, with about the same strength.

"Now?"

"It's--it's fucking heavy. More thud than sting."

"It'll leave bruises."

"If you do it any harder, yeah."

"Let me try something here."

Julius adjusted his grip, thought about aim, and tried for a little bit of a crack with the end. He caught Malcolm's left buttock quite neatly, with a most satisfying snap.

"Ow!" And then Malcolm laughed, so Julius knew it hadn't been truly painful. "Fucking flap on the end stings, but it's the braid that'll do the work."

"Likely to break the skin if I'm not careful."

Malcolm took his hands down from the bedpost without asking permission. Julius raised an eyebrow. He came over and took the whip from Julius and turned it over in his hands. "Yeah. You ever do that to a man? Draw blood?"

"Once." Julius smiled to himself. "At a club once. I had a mind to swing a bullwhip and a fellow there wanted to be whipped to blood. It was a, a rush. Never experienced anything quite like it since. Simply amazing. Never caught his name, but he was a handsome man. All muscle. Stoic. Completely silent until I drew blood, then made the most amazing sounds. Had him up on a St Andrew's cross."

"Yeah?" Malcolm said, and there was something odd in his voice, but Julius was wrapped up in the memory of that night. He'd had sex with the man afterward, overwhelmed by the flood of emotion and the urge to care for his partners that always overmastered him after he'd inflicted pain on them. He'd wondered once or twice in the days following if he ought to have asked the man's name, but it had been a passing whim. Quite a hardcore evening, really, one of the more extreme in his experience. Blood-play with a stranger, quite out of character.

Julius took the whip back from Malcolm and ran his hands over it. It was indeed a heavy thing, with a sharpness to the edges of the strands, more vicious than he'd quite anticipated. Perhaps a whip for a stouter target than Malcolm.

"I think I shall use this to leash you only. It's too risky to use it for anything but the most severe punishment."

"You think so?" And there was an odd emotion in that that made Julius look over at Malcolm.

"Yes. Best to stick with the strap."

Malcolm was on him in the next second, completely shocking him. He'd kicked Julius's legs out from under him and had him on the floor. Julius struggled, but he was pinned. Malcolm was kneeling on his arms with his hand on his throat. His pet had him pinned and Julius had no idea why.

"Let me up at once! I insist!"

"Fuck you! Fuck you, Nicholson! It belongs to *me*, right? Me!"

"What? What are you talking about?"

"That look on your face when you tell that fucking story. When you think about whipping somebody to blood you're gonna fucking think about *me*, you hear?"

"Malcolm!"

"You're mine. That fucking look on your face belongs to me, not to some cunt whose name you never bothered to learn. You fucking cunt!"

Malcolm ripped at his shirt. Buttons flew. Before Julius could yell Malcolm had sunk his teeth into his neck, just under the line of his jaw. It was no love bite. Julius's arms were free now, so he shoved Malcolm away.

"Ow! Malcolm! What's come over you?"

"Have I fucking done enough to deserve it yet? Do I have to bite you again?"

"Deserve what?"

And he bit in again. Julius found himself quite unconsciously baring his neck for it in submission. Malcolm growled. A wolf, Julius thought, uselessly, he was acting like the wolf he'd been told he was. He was doing exactly as he'd been asked to do. And that meant Julius had to fight him. He was expecting it.

Wrestling. Yes, he'd done this. Julius tensed under him and writhed. Malcolm had shifted himself so he could bite and was vulnerable. A moment of struggle, of shoving at each other, wild grunting, and then Julius flipped them over and was on top. He straddled Malcolm's waist and shoved him flat.

Malcolm pushed against him for one long moment and then collapsed back. He stretched his arms over his head with his palms up. Utter submission from him, in a complete flip from the moment before. What the merry hell was going on? He was breathing hard. So was Julius. And if he confessed it, he was harder now than he'd been before the fight.

"What was that for?" Julius said.

"What do you want? Please tell me. Fucking be honest, yeah? What do you want out of this relationship?"

Julius released his grip on Malcolm's shoulders and sat up. Malcolm remained where he was, palms up. He wanted honesty. Honesty. Malcolm would ask the difficult questions, wouldn't he? Usually far more obscenely than that. What did Julius want? That was complicated, wasn't it? No. In the end it was easy. Nothing mattered to him more than making Malcolm happy. But why?

Julius said, "I want you. All of you."

"I'm yours."

"Are you?"

"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fucking yours. I let you put a fucking collar on me. Julz. I--Shit. Are you fucking mine, though?"

Malcolm covered his eyes with a hand. Julius said nothing, just stroked his bare shoulder. The collar was stark around his neck. It changed how he looked somehow, to see that on him, Julius's collar around his neck. All of Malcolm. He had all of Malcolm. Did Malcolm have all of Julius? Did he *know* he had all of Julius?

The strokes Julius had just delivered had been playful, experimental. They wouldn't inspire the kind of deep soul-baring opening Malcolm needed. Malcolm needed--no, honesty here-- *Julius* needed more than that tonight. He needed to prove to them both that Malcolm was his and that he was Malcolm's. He would always be there for him, holding him, giving him what he needed however tender or however brutal. He'd put a collar with his monogram on the man, a man who would never consent to be owned by anyone else. They both deserved something to mark the occasion. They both deserved what they both craved.

"Malc." The short version of his name, which Julius never used. But he used it now. "Malc. Darling."

"What." He sounded defeated.

"You're quite right."

Malcolm pulled his hands away from his face and stared up at him. "I am?"

"That look belongs to you. I belong to you."

"Julz--"

"I put that collar on you. It means something to me. I owe you my, my--my attention as your master. My fidelity. My love."

"Your love?"

"Yes," Julius said. "My love." That admission had been a long time coming, but of course it was true. It had been true since their first weeks together. Since Malcolm had first had the courage to confess to Julius what he longed for.

"Fuck. Julz."

"I'm going to whip you to blood with your dog whip. So we both remember this night. The night you consented to wear my collar. I want you to have a memory to cherish. Because I love you."

"To blood?"

"To blood." If he could work up the nerve to do it. But the sting in his neck where Malcolm had bitten him was there to goad him to it. The sting and the look on Malcolm's face, so complicated and intense.

"Chain me. Julius. Chain me up. So I don't disgrace myself."

"Of course."

Julius released Malcolm and stood up. He found the leather cuffs from the bedside drawer and buckled around Malcolm's outstretched wrists. There was a chain in the same drawer, which they used occasionally, along with a carabiner that he used to fasten the cuffs together. Julius stood on a chair and reached up to the hook set in one of the ceiling beams just for this purpose. He shortened it by a few links, and again, until Malcolm was stretched out on his toes.

Julius held the whip up to Malcolm's lips. He kissed it, then kissed Julius's fingers. What did that look on his face mean? It was such a strange look for Malcolm. No rage, no resistance, just a mysterious distance. He had retreated into himself somewhere.

"I'm going to take a few practice strokes before I whip you in earnest. Then I will give you three strokes hard enough to break the skin. So you know what to expect."

Malcolm swallowed and looked away from him. Julius understood, then.

"Are you afraid, darling?"

"Always. Every fucking time."

"Will you be brave for me?"

"I-- Julius. Kiss me."

The words were demanding but his face was pleading. Julius kissed him, a long tender kiss. Malcolm's eyes were closed but Julius could not look away from him. Lovely face, tears on his cheeks even though the whipping was yet to come. So open he was, so pliant, so yielding, as if he'd already been whipped. Julius let himself savor it, then pulled away. Stepped back, around, behind him.

Such a fragile-looking man he was, bound like this. Nothing to him, no muscle at all. Narrow shoulders, ribs visible, pale skin. He marked easily. His skin would break easily. And yet Julius knew that Malcolm would despise him if he shrank from the task. As ever. Malcolm demanded that he not shrink from his responsibility. He was half hard, as always when he was waiting to be whipped. Malcolm needed this. Needed it regularly. Needed Julius's steady hand on the whip, needed his judgement about when to use it, when to hold back. When not to hold back in the least. Malcolm. So fierce and so intense in everything that he did. He demanded the best from Julius. He would get the best from him.

Julius shook the whip out. Thick at his end of it, thinner at the end where the braids split for the wrist loop, and then there was the tag on the end that could be quite devastating. But it was the weight that would do it.

He raised it and struck, aiming for the left shoulder. Malcolm gasped. Yes, this whip was brutal. Julius would need to be careful with it. No hesitation, however, but another stroke, this time across the right. And again, finding a rhythm. Malcolm whimpered, even though this was just the warmup.

He had a sense of the weight now, and how it moved when he swung. He was now confident that he could hit what he aimed for and that he would not injure Malcolm any more than Malcolm wished to be injured.

That urge to talk, to give a little speech, was on him. Julius bit his tongue. Nothing more than fear from him. Fear about what he was to do. He remembered that night at the club, the joy with which he'd swung the bullwhip. Malcolm deserved that now. He deserved to own that corner of Julius's heart.

He certainly owned the rest of it.

Julius raised his arm and struck as hard as he dared. It was a shocking noise in the quiet of the bedroom, the thud of the whip and the strangled cry from Malcolm. Then came the creak of the chain and then another sound from Malcolm, a word that Julius could not make out. Julius watched him swing for an instant, catch himself. He stepped closer to look at Malcolm's back: the whip had left a livid weal, already red, but the skin was intact. Well. Courage, Nicholson, courage.

Wait for Malcolm to catch his breath, wait for the second wave of pain to wash over him and claim him. Count out seconds. Do it now.

"Count to three for me now, pet," Julius said. Malcolm shuddered and went still.

Julius struck. Malcolm cried out, lost his footing, and hung from the chain. Julius stepped in again and steadied him. Yes, oh yes, there it was: across his left shoulder a break, blood beading on his skin. He was trembling at the end of the chain and his ribs were wet with sweat. Julius stroked his face. Tears, lovely tears on that face, streaming from those lovely blue eyes.

"Count, pet."

"One. Thank you, sir."

Julius gave him a kiss in reward, then let go.

Left shoulder again or right? No, he would stay with the left; it was easier to be sure the lash went where he wanted it.

Julius screwed up his courage to the pitch, and struck even harder. Not quite a scream, but something close, and then his name repeated until Julius came in close to hold him and kiss him.

"Two, sir. Oh God, Julz."

Julius kissed him again. Yes, there it was, the utter surrender that the both of them craved. Blood on Malcolm's back, tears on his face, sweat on his chest, and he had achieved that which he longed for.

"One more, darling. You okay? Can you take it?"

"You love me?"

"Yes, darling, I love you."

"Yeah, I can take it. Do it."

Step back, raise the whip again, and this time swing with all his strength, all his heart and courage behind it, all his love in that one brutal moment, and yes, there it was, a full-throated scream from Malcolm, choked off, and then Malcolm was calling his name. Julius flung the whip down and caught him around the waist, held him up. He was whimpering but the look on his face was triumphant. Up on the chair again, unclip his cuffs, hold him tight, ease him to the floor. Malcolm curled up around himself shivering. Julius stroked his hair, his unmarked shoulder.

"Darling," Julius said. "Pet. My brave pet."

Malcolm reached up and touched his bleeding shoulder, winced, and looked at his fingers. He licked at them. "Yeah," he said, and his voice was slurry. "You fucking did it. Fucking mine now."

"I'm yours now, yes, darling. And I'm going to take you right now, on the floor."

Malcolm nodded and licked at his fingers again.

Julius stripped himself as rapidly as he could, dropping his clothing where he stood. He found a condom in the bedside drawer, rolled it on. Smeared lubricant over himself. He was impatient, but he couldn't allow himself to hurt Malcolm again tonight. Not with the blood still bright on his back.

Malcolm was on his side, one leg pulled up. Julius pushed the tip of his penis into him. Malcolm gasped. Julius rocked his hips, working his way further in. Malcolm pushed back against him. Tight, so tight right now, but opening for him slowly. He was whimpering quietly with each thrust. It had to be hurting him, but it would pass. It was passing already. Julius could feel him relaxing, feel his erection returning.

"How does it feel, darling?"

"Fucking good. You feel good. Always do. Love taking your cock."

"Do you think you can come after that?" Malcolm was hard in his hand, but that wasn't always enough after an intense experience--no, phrase it properly. After that much pain.

Malcolm said, "Yeah. I can. Want to."

"I want you to come for me, while I'm making love to you. Let it happen when you're ready. Okay?"

"Don't let go of me, Julz, just--"

"I've got you. Pet."

Julius took him in hand and stroked in time with his thrusts, that is to say, slowly, steadily, deeply. He'd whipped Malcolm as hard as he could. He'd made a man scream. He'd made a man he loved scream. There were three livid stripes across Malcolm's back where the whip had broken the skin. It was unbelievably arousing, those little beads of bright blood, the way they smeared across his back under Julius's fingers. Julius had long since known peace with the insight that he was a sadist, that he loved inflicting pain on men who loved receiving pain. He knew now that he couldn't do it casually again. Never again would he whip a man who didn't need him. Not just the whip, but him.

"God, Malcolm, are you mine?"

"Yeah, I'm yours. Your pet. Fucking belong to you now."

"Say it again."

"I'm your pet. Your pup. Your wolf. Oh, Julz. Fuck. Feels so good, you fuckin' me."

And then his breath was coming fast and he was pushing himself back onto Julius, which meant he was close, so Julius stroked him harder, faster. He was there, his head back, that choked-off cry he always made, and he was coming over Julius's hand, onto his own belly, and tightening around Julius's penis, tightening and shuddering. The feeling of a man coming around him, so lovely.

He rolled Malcolm onto his face and drove into him hard and fast, seeking his own pleasure now. Friction, a mere mindless urge for friction, for the deepest penetration he could find. A hand on Malcolm's shoulder, on that bleeding broken flesh, pushing him down into the carpet. Cover him, mount him, dominate him. The sound of his hips slapping Malcolm's buttocks, of Malcolm moaning underneath him, of his own breathing. And then Julius was coming at last, coming deep inside Malcolm's body.

Afterward, of course, Julius was all tender solicitous care and Malcolm was all pliant submission. It was their way, what they each sought from the experience. He was shakier than usual, perhaps, more clinging. Julius wrapped him up warm in a robe and helped him drink Lucozade until he stopped shivering. He declined to unlock the collar, and he kept two fingers hooked into the ring as much as possible. Malcolm was his, now, and he would not let go.

He was forced to let go when they were in the shower together, however, and it was time to wash Malcolm's wounds. Nothing serious, nothing terrible, no scarring likely with proper care, but it was still shocking to see on him. Malcolm himself was deeply impressed by them. Julius held a hand mirror so he could see his back in the wall mirror.

"Fuck."

"You're beautiful."

"I need," Malcolm said, "a less sodding painful way to prove myself to you. Couldn't you fucking get off on tickling me instead of whipping me?"

The whipping was entirely the choice of Malcolm's complicated, tangled psyche, not that Julius chose to say that out loud. What he said was, "I am, in your words, a kinky cunt, and these things require ritual. Hold still while I put some antiseptic on it."

Malcolm swore when he did it, but stood still for it. Antiseptic, gauze taped across the wounds, and that would do for the night. Now to tend to himself. Julius tipped his head to the side and touched the bite marks gingerly. The mirror told him that they were quite high on his neck, just under the corner of his jaw. They would go septic if he didn't tend to them. Malcolm had drawn blood as well. A blood ritual for them both. Well, that was fitting.

He reached for the tube on the counter.

"Let me do that," Malcolm said, and he took the antiseptic away from Julius. Julius hissed in pain as Malcolm's fingers dabbed it on. "Candy-arse. I hardly broke the skin."

"It's going to be visible tomorrow unless I cover it up. Perhaps a turtleneck."

"You will do no such fuckin' thing," Malcolm said, and he bit at Julius's neck again, gently, but just hard enough that Julius tensed up against him. Malcolm held Julius's gaze in the mirror for a long moment, until Julius nodded his concession. Malcolm released him with a little shove.

Julius had adopted a wolf indeed. Well, he was in for it now.
