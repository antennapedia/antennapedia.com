<p>Giles had finally stuttered to a halt. He was perched on the edge of the study table, opposite Buffy slouched in her chair. He rubbed his hands on his trousers, obviously nervous about whatever her reaction was going to be. Buffy cocked her head at him. She stuck a finger under her own jaw and pressed her mouth closed, ostentatiously. She'd known Giles was dating Miss Calendar, but this was far more serious.</p>

<p>He was watching her still, hanging on her reaction as if it mattered in the slightest.</p>

<p>"So, wait, Giles, I don't get what you're asking me. 'Cause I'm not throwing a bachelor party for you. That's way more something Xander should do. Only since we just learned he's a virgin, that's maybe not a good idea. And he isn't old enough to buy you cigars anyway."</p>

<p>"Buffy! No, it's just, just... well, you're my Slayer. You ought to know things like this."</p>

<p>"And now I know. Congratulations!" Buffy grinned at him. "I think it's of the good. You get this sappy look on your face when you see her. It's really kinda sweet."</p>

<p>Giles fidgeted and yanked out his handkerchief, and Buffy knew there was something else. </p>

<p>"Out with it."</p>

<p>"She's, ah, that is to say, she, we're expecting. In September."</p>

<p>Giles's face was bright red. Buffy blushed as well. Weird to think about geeky tweed-man having sex, but he obviously had. With Miss Calendar, who was completely beautiful. She took another look at the textbook with arms, and wondered what Miss Calendar saw in him. She had a moment of dislocation: she had no idea what Miss Calendar saw when she looked at Giles. All she could see was a embarrassed Watcher, sliding his glasses back onto his nose.</p>

<p>"Again with the not getting why you're telling me. Other than to say, hey mister, the health teacher has a class you maybe ought to have taken."</p>

<p>Giles's blush faded and his face went serious. "There are tactical considerations. Families are targets. I am making your job more difficult. They say one ought to avoid entanglements like this. Perhaps I ought not--"</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't hold it in.</p>

<p>"Giles. Don't be an idiot. This is what I'm fighting for. Remember? You said it yourself. I have friends, and now I'm going to have more friends. Including a very tiny friend, who can't walk or talk or anything. What should I call him? Her? What's the word for your Watcher's baby? Step-Watcher? Watcher Junior? Cousin?"</p>

<p>"Godchild," said Giles, abruptly.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned at him again. "Cool."</p>
