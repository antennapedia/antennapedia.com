<p>Push the broom. Don&#8217;t look over at her. Just push the broom. Lord, she&#8217;d tasted sweet. And her perfume: amber and honey. Oh, no, she&#8217;d noticed that he was looking at her. Say something. Say something not about her lips and the way they&#8217;d parted under his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anya&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, co-owner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, what is it about rabbits, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a bad experience with rabbits, once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I nearly choked to death on a bone in some rabbit stew. My human mother had been very sloppy when she cleaned the hare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giles stopped pushing his broom. &#8220;Uh, and this gave you a phobia? Really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That was a clumsy lie. Actually it was an encounter with a warren infested by vampiric rabbits about two hundred years ago, in Germany. They had nasty fangs, all bloody from the voles and shrews they&#8217;d been sucking dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my, that sounds&#8212; Anya, animals can&#8217;t contract vampirism.&#8221; Giles chased a pile of dust with his broom over to the debris collection point by the counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I was lying again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman who was married to a furrier once needed vengeance from me. She wished for the bodies of the animals he&#8217;d killed to reanimate and tear him to shreds. He&#8217;d mostly worked in rabbit fur. There were dozens of zombie rabbit bodies hopping around his shop. It was horrible, even if I was the one who made it happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>That had the ring of truth. Giles felt a mix of horror and sympathy. He leaned his broom against the counter and took a step toward her. &#8220;That&#8217;s awful. That&#8212;&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;That was a lie, too. I&#8217;m just allergic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giles let out an exasperated breath. &#8220;Really, Anya, you&#8217;re impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m impossible? I&#8217;m impossible? You were completely unsympathetic earlier!&#8221; Anya stomped up to him and waved a finger in his face. She stopped, suddenly. She leaned very very near him. Giles suddenly couldn&#8217;t breathe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anya?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood with her eyes closed, her face near his collar. He could smell amber and honey. </p>

<p>&#8220;Anya&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just realized how good bay rum smells, on an adult male.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giles closed his eyes, and surrendered.</p>
