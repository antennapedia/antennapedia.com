"Xander."

"Yeah?"

"Please take off the ski goggles. You keep running into me."

"Oh. Uh. Right. You figured out that they&#8217;re not&#8212;"

"Pretty much immediately."

Xander didn&#8217;t know what to do with the damn things. Couldn&#8217;t just drop them and litter. He loosened the elastic and let the goggles fall to his chest. He trudged along side by side with Giles for a while. "So, uh, you&#8217;re sure she slept with this guy?"

"Yes. I was talking to Willow about the gem, in their dorm room, and she came in wearing party clothes."

"At ten am."

"Yes."

"And now she&#8217;s all freaked out and depressed &#8216;cause her one-night-standed her."

"So it seems. Not that she&#8217;s talked to either one of us directly." Giles held a branch aside for Xander. Xander ducked past, then held the next one for Giles. This trail was looking overgrown.

"How the hell do you cope with it, Giles?"

"Classes in adolescent psychology."

"Seriously? Wow. That must have come in handy."

"Many times."

"I suppose you could straighten her out and get her unfreaked."

"If she&#8217;d talk to me. I&#8217;m feeling rather discarded at the moment. Like last year&#8217;s shoes."

The path flattened out, and opened up. Xander followed Giles across a grassy hillside to a jumble of boulders above a brief drop. Below them was a road and a cul de sac, with five or six cars parked.

"Oh, hey, Lovers Point, and its wonderful view." Xander stood on the boulder, next to Giles, and looked down at the lights of Sunnydale, stretching down to the moonlit Pacific. There was the highway, there was the main street. Giles sprawled out, and let his long legs dangle over the edge of the boulder. Xander sat himself down between Giles&#8217; knees and leaned back. Giles slipped an arm around his waist and nuzzled at his ear. Well, at least they could be outmoded together.
