Want to write a continuation of one of these stories? Want to borrow one of the mini-universes depicted? Be my guest.

Have fun! Write! Archive, save stories, share them, record them as podfic, write commentaries on them, remix, continue, write in the universe of, transform by whatever means you like. Don't claim you wrote what you didn't write yourself, and that goes for what I wrote as well as for the canonical sources. A link to my definitive story archive here is appreciated.

Share and enjoy.

<h3 name='ratings'>Story ratings and warnings</h3>

This archive uses a simple ratings system to mark story content.

*Adult:* For adults only. Rough equivalents are X and NC-17. The rating usually indicates explicit sex.

*Mature:* For mature readers. Adult topics are discussed but not in explicit detail. There might be violence and four-letter words as well. The rough equivalent of an R-rated movie.

*General:* The story might contain some sex or violence indirectly described, but doesn't focus on difficult material. The equivalent of PG and G movies.

The warnings header marks stories that contain depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of 18. (Note that <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> canonically includes this.) It also marks stories with direct depictions of sexual violence and character death. I warn for nothing else. See a story's tag list if you need more information about its content.
