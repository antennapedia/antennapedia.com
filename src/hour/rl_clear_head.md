## Turning Point

The first time had been after the news of the attack on Freddie. They'd gone to the hospital, and nothing Randall had said had got them in to see Freddie. Lix had cried on his shoulder, and he'd taken her to his home and put her to bed between his clean sheets. They'd clung to each other, and at some point in the night, it had turned to a gentle, comforting lovemaking. So different from how it had been in Spain, in his memory. He'd been drunk the whole time. Now he was sober, with all the edges of life unblunted. He knew it was touch-and-go for Freddie. Saw in Lix's unspoken words that there had been something between them at some time.

It didn't matter. Lives were long, and hearts were complex, and a man who'd run as far and as fast as Randall had had no business criticizing.

He'd held her, and loved her, and let himself go as much as he ever did. The love of his life in his arms, the sound of her pleasure in his ears, the feel of her body surrounding him, her scent on him: it was heaven in the wee hours.

Heaven was revisited often in the days that followed. No words spoken between them, but they were together again. Randall's heart was on his sleeve with her. It had always been, even when he'd run. When he'd known he could live that life no more. When he'd known that it was stop drinking or die.

He said no words about Lix's drinking, but one day she too stopped. "Coffee for me," she said, to him, and he came back to their table with two coffees. She leaned her head against his shoulder. "Don't feel like it," she said. "Scarcely have the stomach for coffee."

"Are you ill?"

"Never better," she said. But he caught her asleep in her office the next day. Up too late making love with him, perhaps. He resolved to give her some respite from his attentions, not that she seemed to want such a thing.

"Randall," she said to him one day. "I think we need to talk. Tonight?"

"Of course," he said, puzzled. They were together every night. Why would they not be tonight? But to his surprise she took him to her flat, not out, and made him a bit of dinner with a candle on the table and sat afterward gazing at him.

"Randall, dearest."

He said nothing, but took her hand. There was fear in his heart, though she seemed affectionate enough.

"I think we have a bit of a situation. An issue."

He raised an eyebrow.

"I'm in a bit of a situation."

He clung tighter. "You mean?"

"Yes."

"Lix."

"I'm not sure what you want."

"What I want! Lix."

"I need to hear it. In words. Preferably good Anglo-Saxon monosyllables if you can. Because I'm not sure I'm capable of understanding anything more complex just now."

There were tears in his eyes. Randall swallowed, composed himself. He framed his speech as best he could, given the emotion in him. Simple words. Simple concepts. The candle on the table. Their dirty plates. The water glasses. The night in Spain when she'd told him, over a bottle already emptied, another to follow. Tonight his mind was clear. His heart was clear. His hands were shaking, but they were clear as well.

"Will you marry me?" he said.

## Marriage

They were married quietly in a little church in Edinburgh, because that was where Randall's aged mother lived now. His older sister came in from Glasgow to be there. Bel came in support of Lix, with a much-battered but recovering Freddie sitting in the pews behind, because he could not stand comfortably for very long. It was a quiet wedding because that was Randall's preference, but it was a happy wedding nonetheless. The groom could not contain his glow of joy.

Lix told him afterward that it was the brides who were supposed to be radiant, not the grooms. He merely smiled, unzipped the back of her dress, and took her to bed tenderly, cautiously.

"Mrs Brown," he said to her, afterward, rolling it around in his mouth.

"Most boring name ever, darling," she said. "You ought to have taken mine."

"Randall Storm." He tilted his head, considering, then nodded. "Our child shall take it as a middle name."

"Dougan Storm Brown. Sophia Storm Brown. A trifle lopsided."

"Dougan?"

"Your mother is set on Dougan."

"No. Peter."

"All right, then. Peter Brown it is. If it's a boy."

Neither one of them commented on her choice of a girl's name. There was no disagreement between them on that point. Lix turned on her side, Randall curled up warm behind her with a hand resting on her belly. He woke her in the morning with urgent kisses and her new name repeated with a rough voice. Randall had, she thought, been waiting a very long time for this. She was sorry, sometimes, that she'd made him wait. But he was a better man now than he had been, a better man now for having gone through the fire and emerged purified and sober on the other side.

The couple spent a quiet week in a cottage on the coast, and returned to London afterward in amity. Lix intended to work her way through in the evening news writing department until forced to stop. Randall quietly pulled strings to make it so.

Lix had, to her surprise and Randall's continued disbelief, a serene pregnancy, an easy pregnancy, a boring pregnancy. She'd done it once before, little though she liked to dwell on that. She knew what she was in for. And when her water broke and labor was on her, she was perfectly calm as she informed Randall that he might want to fetch a cab.

## Wedding night

A hotel in Edinburgh, old, a little drafty, but near enough to the pretty places of the city. One night there, then off to a cottage somewhere more remote, where they would read and talk and plan for the future. Or simply read and rest. Randall wasn't sure what they'd do. Something calming.

But first they had the wedding night to get through, in this grand old creaking edifice, in a rather lovely room with a four-poster bed.

Randall had, superstitiously, been keeping himself away from Lix's bed while preparing for the wedding. He'd been doing so since she'd broken the news to him of her pregnancy, which amused her. But something in him felt it would be improper. He would wait, and take her to bed when he'd made an honest woman of her. He knew from experience that waiting sharpened the hunger, and he would savor her all the more for it.

Honest woman. An odd expression. He mulled it over as he undressed in the bath, to give her the privacy she'd requested to change. He would rather have said she'd made an honest man of him. But of course she'd done that long ago. When he'd lain awake in his tent in Normandy, sweating out the remains of the last drink he'd ever taken, knowing that he had to get through this war with dignity, as he had not the last one.

Clothes folded, because he was an orderly man, and the belt of his robe tied. Randall tapped on the door and received Lix's permission to come out to her.

Lix in a negligee. Sheer, faintly peach. He could see the tips of her nipples through it, the dark patch of hair below her belly. He cleared his throat, blinked. He was still capable of snapping to attention like a soldier spotting a general, even at his age. Well. He went to her. Slipped his arms around her, kissed her. Let his hand wander, find a breast, run a fingertip over that erect nipple. Lix made a most satisfactory sound. He kissed her and she made that sound again into his mouth. Her hand slipped down and cupped him. He pushed against her almost helplessly. She'd always known how to touch him, from that first night together onwards. Clever fingers, clever lips, clever mind. Lix. She was going to send him over before he'd even touched her.

"Shall we go to bed, dear?" he said. His voice wasn't quite right.

She smiled at him wickedly. "Perhaps we should."

He tumbled her back onto that bed, the four-poster, and lifted that negligee. She spread her thighs for him and he knelt between them. He let himself look at her lovely lovely sex. Not the only woman Randall had been privileged to see, to touch, to penetrate, but the one he'd loved best, because he loved the mind in the body best. Dark hair, wet, glistening labia, the sound she made when he kissed the little nub at the top. She was the woman who'd taught him how this act, who'd shown him how much delight he could bring to a woman with his lips and tongue. How he need not stint her, because she could cry out over and over from this, and again when he lay over her. Such good sounds. His wife moaning under him. His wife, asking him to take her. Oh, yes, he would oblige, and revel in the different sound she made when he took himself in hand and nudged against her, slipped into her. Oh, sweet feeling, pure pleasure, flesh on flesh, his Lix, saying his name so softly as he moved into her. He watched his body join with hers and smiled. All the way, all the way in, out again, listening to her sigh. So good.

"Mrs Brown," he said and thrust into her again.

Call him old-fashioned, call him outright barbaric, but something in him felt that now it was accomplished, now she was his wife. He was inside her and she surrounded him and she was everything and she was joined with him now. Let no man put them asunder. No war, no grief, no bottle, no words, no fears. They were one. Lying over her, in the cradle of her hips, moving with her, listening to her little gasps, touching her in the ways he'd learned so long ago were the ways she liked best.

He was graying and there were crow's feet at the corners of his eyes, and he would be an old man when their child was grown, but he could not bring himself to regret it. To regret her. Lix, his wife, reaching her crisis in his arms, shuddering around him. Oh, yes, he was close to it himself, close to spending himself inside his wife-- his *wife*, his wife, who was already three months gone with his child, his child, everything, it was all too much, Randall couldn't keep it straight in his head, it was all too good and he was at last a man worthy of her.

He lay over her afterward and tried not to let too much of his weight fall onto her, but he couldn't bear to be parted from her just yet. At last he softened and slipped out of her. His wife. He'd just made love to his wife. He rolled back onto the pillows and pushed his sweaty hair away from his brow.

Lix leaned on an elbow next to him and smiled down at him.

"I love watching you come apart," she said.

"Shall try to take that as a compliment."

"It is, dear."

"Well then."

He tugged her down to rest against his shoulder. He already knew he wanted to wake her in the morning with more touches, with his lips on her breast. His wife. Lix Brown. Randall smiled into the dark of the room.


## Interlude

Sophia's birthday. Randall knew the date, of course. He knew that Lix knew it. He did not dare mention it to her. She was heavy with their second child, the one that would be born with his name, the one neither one of them would run from. He didn't want to trouble her by reminding her of their loss, the grief he had barely allowed himself to feel. Mere hours to feel it before he'd had to function as a producer, to fret over the life that might yet be saved, of his young reporter. Repress it, hide it, button it away into his breast pocket where everything else was hid.

Her birthday today. He might have had an adult daughter now but for his drinking, the ruin of a man he was. How he frightened Lix with his fidgeting when sober. He was to blame.

His fidgeting was out of control again today. He paced from board to board, rearranging the notices, the thumbtacks. He rearranged the bookshelves of a reporter he was chastising mildly for failing to pursue a source. And when he appeared in Lix's office to take her off to their house, he found himself twitching around the objects on her desk.

"Randall, dear, do stop."

"Sorry," he said, and stuck his hands into his pockets.

"Are you well?"

"Yes, quite. Shall we?"

He offered her his arm. Comforting to feel her squeeze, to walk together to the doors, slowing his pace to match hers. Another month to go, she said, and it was beginning to burden her.

He fidgeted again in the cab, touching everything there was to touch and move, rubbing at his knees. His fault. He'd lost her. He'd never known her. Never held her in his arms. Did he deserve this child Lix was bearing for him now? Did he deserve to have married her?

No.

"Randall. Talk to me."

"It's nothing."

"I know what day it is, dear."

"Of course you do," he murmured, and allowed her to take his hand.

Lix was on his arm again as they made their way up the walk to their front door, but he knew that she was supporting him more than he her. Inside, taking her coat off, helping her to a seat where she could put her feet up. He knelt before her and laid his head in what remained of her lap. He rested a hand on her great belly, where their child turned and kicked. She, he ought to have a sister. It was an injustice. One of the many great injustices of the war, but he must also bear the guilt of this one.

"I'm sorry," he said.

"I know, dear. It's all right now."

Her fingers in his hair, stroking the back of his neck, sneaking their way into his shirt collar. He'd never deserve any of this, but he'd been given it, and he would accept it gratefully.

## Crisis

Randall had command of himself in a crisis. He told himself this but he knew it was true from his experience through two wars. Was pregnancy a crisis or normality? He asked himself that question as he helped Lix-- his wife, his Lix, his life-- into the cab. She was calm enough in the minutes between bouts of labor pains, but he could not be. Her face, her bitten lip, her hand tightening on his-- Lix ought not feel pain ever, never mind that much. And he could do nothing but give the cabbie directions in the steadiest voice he could summon.

She gripped his hand tighter during the ride. Randall consulted his watch, counted minutes. Ten between the first in the cab and the second.

Great Ormond street, the hospital, up and in. Lix tucked onto a bed, wheeled away from him. He attempted to follow and was diverted by firm nurses into a waiting room near the obstetrics ward. He was alone in the ward, save for an abandoned tea cup, left half-full. Some poor brute of a man, waiting, called away with his tea half-finished. Randall remembered, almost wistfully, the dizzy feeling of brandy in his blood. It was the first time he'd wished for it since the fall of Paris.

He paced. Command, command, stay in command.

Lix, pregnant with his child. His wife, giving birth to his child. The inevitable consequence of union of man and woman. Not inevitable. Frequent. Nature demanded it. Capricious nature, granting him two children with Lix. He was not a religious man, but he considered now praying that he might be allowed to hold this one in his arms. That his wife be allowed to live.

There were sounds in the ward behind the door he was not allowed not pass. His wife's voice, not speaking words but crying out in pain. It was madness that they kept him from her at this moment, madness that he could not be with her, holding her hand, or sponging her face. He could be of some use. The sight of blood did not affect him. Hadn't since his first shelling, when he'd found himself able to load film into his camera and document what lay before him that he could not help.

Not a thought he wanted at a moment like this.

He turned himself to the arrangement of the waiting room. Chairs, tables. The order of the magazines laid out for reading by other husbands waiting as he did. Alphabetized, in order by time. Arrayed upon the tables with tops aligned. It was, he knew, useless and no longer a comfort, but it was habit. Something to fill his time. Something to occupy spaces between dim cries from the ward beyond.

He had command of himself in a time of crisis, he reminded himself. Not all of his resources, but enough of them. His resources, in this moment, need only keep him from breakdown, tears, or an assault upon that door at the sound of his wife's voice. Silence, then feet rushing around, then the sound of squalling.

Randall covered his eyes with a hand and allowed tears to fall.

By the time they came out to fetch him, he'd regained his composure.

It was a boy, they told him, and invited him into the room beyond. He stumbled in, saw Lix sitting in the bed, hair a ruin, face still sweaty, but serene now, looking down at the bundle in her arms. Cap, red wrinkled face under, a wise expression on its-- his-- face. Murky eyes, no color he could distinguish.

Randall found his self-command now, with Lix smiling wearily at him.

"Hello, Randall," Lix said to him. His wife, holding his son. "Meet Peter Storm Brown."

"Delighted to meet you, Peter Storm Brown. I think we shall get on famously."

He touched a finger to the tiny tiny hand curled against his son's chin. His son.

## Reading

Infants were agents of chaos. Squalling, spitting, urinating agents of chaos. Randall had, in defiance of current practice, learned to change a nappie, and he had also learned to fear this process. Peter Storm Brown was entirely capable of pissing straight into the air while his wet nappie was being removed, and woe betide a man who leaned over him when this happened.

"Randall, dear, this is what the nanny is for," said Lix, to whom this never seemed to happen. He had enough money for such luxuries as a nanny, and he did want Lix not to feel as if she had to give up everything because they were now parents.

Were again parents.

Little Peter in his arms, a tiny thing that met his gaze solemnly and latched onto his finger. Little Peter knew his mother and he knew his father and when he first learned to smile Randall wanted to be there to see it. He had missed an entire brief lifetime for Sophia; he would be an old man when Peter was grown. He was determined to miss no more than forced now.

And thus it was that he sat in his armchair of an evening, Lix curled up nearby on the sofa, Peter in the crook of his arm. He read to the boy. *In that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the river Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest, covering the greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between Sheffield and the pleasant town of Doncaster.* Not a thing Peter would understand, perhaps, but Randall liked to believe that it would remain with him, especially if read in the accent of a modern-day Scot. Robin Hood next, perhaps, or more of the great Scott, or perhaps The Boy's King Arthur. His father had done this for him, so long ago now, and he'd been reading long before he'd been sent to school. Surely Peter would follow suit, particularly with such a clever mother.

So Randall read to his boy, with his wife listening in, her feet up on the sofa. It was a race to see which would be lulled to sleep by his voice first, his son or his wife. Randall did not take it as criticism. He would sit happily, dandling his boy, with his beloved wife (his wife! Lix! with him at last) near enough that he could smell her perfume. He would keep them safe, he swore, this time he would not turn his back.

## Nightmares

Randall had just begun to kiss Lix with some kind of intent when their son rapped on their bedroom door. A moment later it creaked open. He let his head fall onto her shoulder and sighed.

"The lock, Randall, dearest," Lix said, with resignation, but Randall merely sighed again. Even if the door had been locked, he'd have interrupted their embrace to fuss over their son.

The bed creaked, and Randall felt his son's weight beside them. He extricated himself from Lix and edged himself away to make room. Peter wedged himself between them and clung to him like a limpet, with his face pressed against Randall's chest. He was crying. Randall kissed the crown of his head. Such wild hair his boy had, so untamed even when cut short, which Lix could hardly bear to do. She was too fond of the curls and her blue-eyed boy.

Randall rocked him, and Lix stroked his back, and eventually Peter calmed down enough that he sat up between them and rubbed at his nose.

"Hullo," Randall said to his son. "What has brought you out of your bed and into ours tonight?"

"I had a dream," Peter said. He fidgeted with his hands in that way he had. Randall found it familiar in intent, though not in specifics. He'd had his own tics as a boy. Peter's were different. This fidget meant he was thinking, which he did intensely and often.

"What sort of dream, dear?" Randall said.

"It had robots in."

"Not friendly robots?"

"Not these ones."

"Ah. Well. Perhaps tomorrow you can draw these robots so that we can recognize them later. Or ask the Doctor to deal with them."

Peter brightened up. "Oh! He could. Can I write?"

"Yes, you may write. Tomorrow. We shall send him one of your drawings. He'll sort them out."

Peter seemed to accept this, for the next thing he said was, "You were hugging Mum."

"I was hugging her, yes. I hug her quite often. I shall hug her again later."

Peter nodded solemnly. "Mummy hugs are good."

"Quite. Now. Shall we inspect your room for robots?"

"Yes, please."

Randall slid out of bed and took his son by the hand.
